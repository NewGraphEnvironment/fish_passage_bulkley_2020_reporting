# New Graph Environment was retained by the Canadian Wildlife Federation and Nupgu Limited Partnership in the fall of 2020 to plan and conduct fish passage and habitat confirmation assessments at road-stream crossings as part of connectivity restoration planning targeting westslope cutthrout trout. Although some planning was conducted for both the Elk River watershed upstream of the Elko Dam near Elko, BC and the Flathead River, on the ground surveys in 2020 focused on the Elk River and tributaries located upstream of the Elko Dam.

The Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern BC undertook an initiative in April of 2020 to plan and conduct fish passage restoration planning activities in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups which are sub-basins of the Skeena River watershed.  The initiative was supported by a grant from the Habitat Conservation Trust Fund that leveraged funding committed in the fall of 2019 from the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and the Canadian Wildlife Federation.  New Graph Environment and Hillcrest Geographics were subcontracted to complete the work which included updating and implementation of GIS analysis tools used to quantify potential habitat gains of fish passage restoration for target species as well as on the ground fish passage assessments and habitat confirmation assessments.  In August of 2020, following a province wide prioritization exercise and a series of workshops, the Canadian Wildlife Federation selected the Bulkley River watershed group as a target watershed for connectivity planning efforts supported by a grant from the British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund.  Recognizing synergies between the two initiatives, project activities of both initiatives became a collaboration between SERNbc and CWF with extensive input from numerous organizations and individuals connected to the watershed. Although fish passage restoration planning was conducted for both the Morice River watershed group and the Bulkley River watershed group, on the ground surveys in 2020 focused primarily within Bulkley River tributaries.

The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat [@Bramblett_2002; @swalesRoleOffChannelPonds1989; @diebel_etal2015EffectsRoad].  Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues [@slaneyFishHabitatRehabilitation1997; @cote_etal2005Fishpassage]. As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement and deactivation designs.

Although remediation and replacement of crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant, impacts of the work often complex to isolate/quantify and outside investments in infrastructure on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical from all perspectives.  When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising for ecosystem restoration activities, cost benefit relationships and the ethics of fish passage investments should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative restoration activities (ex. transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, etc.).  A Fish Passage Working Group consisting of First Nations, non-profits, stakeholder groups and regulators has been established for the Bulkley River through a connectivity planning initiative spearheaded by the Canadian Wildlife Federation. At the time of reporting, collaborative decision making processes regarding connectivity issues were underway through monthly meetings with results forthcoming in a watershed connectivity remediation plan. At the time of reporting, the scope of connectivity planning explored by the Working Group was limited to the Bulkley River watershed group and excluded the Morice River and other sub-basins of the Skeena River watershed.
