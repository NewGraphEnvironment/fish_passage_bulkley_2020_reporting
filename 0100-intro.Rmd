New Graph Environment and Nupqu Limited Partnership were retained by the Canadian Wildlife Federation in the fall of 2020 to plan and conduct fish passage assessments and habitat confirmation assessments at road-stream crossings within the Elk River watershed group.  Although planning for assessments was conducted for both the Elk River watershed upstream of the Elko Dam near Elko, BC and the Flathead River, assessments focused on the Elk River and tributaries upstream of the Elko Dam.

The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat [@Bramblett_2002; @swalesRoleOffChannelPonds1989].  Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues [@slaneyFishHabitatRehabilitation1997]. Reconnection of fragmented habitats is a management action that can generate some of the highest ecological returns on economic investments relative to other habitat restoration techniques [@saldicaromileStreamHabitatRestoration2004].
