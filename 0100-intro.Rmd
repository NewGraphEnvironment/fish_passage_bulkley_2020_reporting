# New Graph Environment was retained by the Canadian Wildlife Federation and Nupgu Limited Partnership in the fall of 2020 to plan and conduct fish passage and habitat confirmation assessments at road-stream crossings as part of connectivity restoration planning targeting westslope cutthrout trout. Although some planning was conducted for both the Elk River watershed upstream of the Elko Dam near Elko, BC and the Flathead River, on the ground surveys in 2020 focused on the Elk River and tributaries located upstream of the Elko Dam.

The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat [@Bramblett_2002; @swalesRoleOffChannelPonds1989; @diebel_etal2015EffectsRoad].  Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues [@slaneyFishHabitatRehabilitation1997; @cote_etal2005Fishpassage]. As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement and deactivation designs.

Although remediation and replacement of crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant, impacts of the work often complex to isolate/quantify and outside investments in infrastructure on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical from all perspectives.  When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising for ecosystem restoration activities, cost benefit relationships and the ethics of fish passage investments should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative restoration activities (ex. land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, etc.).  A Fish Passage Working Group consisting of First Nations, non-profits, stakeholder groups and regulators has been established for the Bulkley River through a connectivity planning initiative spearheaded by the Canadian Wildlife Federation. At the time of reporting, collaborative decision making processes regarding connectivity issues were underway through monthly meetings with results forthcoming in a watershed connectivity remediation plan. At the time of reporting, the scope of connectivity planning explored by the Working Group was limited to the Bulkley River watershed group and excluded the Morice River and other sub-basins of the Skeena River watershed.
