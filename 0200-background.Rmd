As a result of high-level direction from the provincial government, a Fish Passage Strategic Approach protocol has been developed for British Columbia to ensure that the greatest opportunities for restoration of fish passage are pursued.  A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS).  The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in @fishpassagetechnicalworkinggroupFishPassageStrategic2014 :

 * Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment – Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity.
 * Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation – Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation.
 * Phase 3: Design – Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. 
 * Phase 4: Remediation – Reconnection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers.
