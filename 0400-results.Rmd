## Planning

Following review of background literature, fisheries information, PSCIS and `bcfishpass` outputs, `r tab_plan_sf %>% nrow()` modelled and PSCIS crossings were reviewed to select sites for follow up with Phase 1 and 2 assessments in the Morice River watershed.   `r tab_plan_sf %>% filter(Priority == 'high') %>%  nrow()` crossings ranked as high priority for future follow up with Phase 1 and/or Phase 2 assessments, `r tab_plan_sf %>% filter(Priority == 'moderate') %>%  nrow()` crossings ranked as moderate priorities, and `r tab_plan_sf %>% filter(Priority == 'low') %>%  nrow()` crossings ranked as low priorities. Results are presented `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("in Figure \\@ref(fig:map-interactive) and included as a zipped Google Earth kml file ([Attachment 1](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_bulkley_2020_reporting/raw/master/data/Attachment_1_morice_planning_kml.zip)).

# ## Planning
# Review of the PSCIS database indicated that prior to 2020, `r pscis_historic %>% filter(study_area %ilike% 'elk' & assessment_date < '2020-01-01') %>% nrow()` assessments for fish passage (Phase 1) and `r pscis_historic_phase2 %>% filter(study_area %ilike% 'elk' & assmt_date < '2020-01-01') %>% nrow()` habitat confirmations (Phase 2) have been conducted at crossing structures within the Upper Elk River.  Within the Flathead River watershed `r pscis_historic %>% filter(study_area %ilike% 'flathead' & assessment_date < '2020-01-01') %>% nrow()` fish passage assessments and `r pscis_historic_phase2 %>% filter(study_area %ilike% 'flathead' & assmt_date < '2020-01-01') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` habitat confirmations had been conducted.  Following review of background literature, fisheries information, PSCIS and `bcfishpass` outputs, both modelled and PSCIS sites were selected for follow up with Phase 1 and 2 assessments. Results are included as a zipped package of Google Earth kml files stored  [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_elk_2020_reporting_cwf/raw/master/data/planning_kmls/elk_planning_kmls.zip).

## Phase 1

Field assessments were conducted between `r format(min(pscis_phase1$date), format="%B %d %Y")` and `r format(max(pscis_phase1$date), format="%B %d %Y")` by Allan Irvine, R.P.Bio. and Kyle Prince, P.Biol. A total of `r n_distinct(pscis_phase1$my_crossing_reference)` Phase 1 assessments were conducted with `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Passable') %>% nrow()` crossings considered "passable", `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Potential') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings considered "potential" barriers and `r pscis_phase1 %>% filter(barrier_result == 'Barrier') %>% nrow()` crossings considered "barriers" according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length [@fish_passage_assessments].  Site maps are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[Attachment 2](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/)")} else knitr::asis_output("[Attachment 2](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_bulkley_2020_reporting/raw/master/data/Attachment_2_maps.zip)")` with a summary of crossings assessed, a cost benefit analysis and priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites presented in Table \@ref(tab:cost-est-phase-1). Detailed data with photos are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos]")} else knitr::asis_output("[Attachment 3](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_bulkley_2020_reporting/raw/master/docs/Attachment_3_Phase_1_Data_and_Photos.pdf)")`.


<br>

"Barrier" and "Potential Barrier" rankings used in this project followed @fish_passage_assessments and reflect an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout at any flows potentially present throughout the year [@clarkinNationalInventoryAssessment2005 ;@bellFisheriesHandbookEngineering1991; @thompsonAssessingFishPassage2013].  As noted in @bourne_etal2011Barriersfish, with a detailed review of different criteria in @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating, passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates [@bourne_etal2011Barriersfish; @shaw_etal2016Importancepartial; @mahlum_etal2014EvaluatingBarrier; @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating].  @washingtondepartmentoffishwildlife2009FishPassage present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments.  These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia.

```

<br>

## Phase 2

Although not assessed in 2020, @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage report that the crossing structure located on Highway 16 and Station Creek  (PSCIS  124420, UTM: 9U.586630.6122416) has  been the subject  of  numerous  assessments  and  designs  with  respect  to  the rehabilitation of fish passage, and they rated this crossing as the highest priority for rehabilitation in the Bulkley River watershed.  Gitxsan Watershed Authority reports that Xsan Xsagiibil was a fishing site located at the mouth of Station Creek (Xsi Gwin Sagiiblax) [@wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage].  Identified as a high priority for additional assessments by @rabnett_williams2004Highway16, @skrconsultantsltd_2006FishPassage conducted a detailed inspection, offered rehabilitation  design  options  and  identified  the  natural limits  of  potential  fish distribution to support rehabilitation efforts.  At the time of this report, fish passage at the crossing had not yet been remediated due to complexities and costs associated with rehabilitation designs (Kathryn Graham, Regional Manager Environmental Services - Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure pers. comm.). 

<br>

During 2020 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at `r hab_site_priorities %>% nrow() - 1` sites in the Bulkley River watershed group and one site in the Morice River watershed group.  A total of approximately 18 km of stream was assessed, fish sampling utilizing electrofishing and/or minnowtrapping was conducted at eight sites, and three sites were mapped using remotely piloted aircraft. Of note, in 2020, surveys in some larger mid Bulkley River tributaries with high potential low gradient habitat gains (ex. Toboggan Creek and John Brown Creek) were not conducted due to poor survey conditions caused by high water.  Additionally, assessment at crossings on some large tributary streams in the upper Bulkley River were not conducted due to finite quantities of field time (ex. Ailport Creek, Cesford Creek and Watson Creek). 

<br>

As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary.  In total, `r hab_site_priorities %>% filter(priority %ilike% 'high') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english() %>% str_to_title()` crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, `r hab_site_priorities %>% filter(priority %ilike% 'Moderate') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings were rated as moderate priorities, and `r hab_site_priorities %>% filter(priority %ilike% 'Low') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings were rated as low priorities. Results are summarized in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:map-interactive) and ")}`Tables \@ref(tab:tab-overview) - \@ref(fig:plot-fish-all) with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format as [Attachment 2](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_bulkley_2020_reporting/raw/master/data/habitat_confirmations.xls).  A summary of preliminary modelling results illustrating the quantity of chinook, coho and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-model-all). Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments are presented within site specific reports included as appendices to this document with maps included as [Attachment 2](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/bulkley/).
