# Recommendations

Recommended next steps for fish passage restoration in the Elk River watershed group include:


 * Recognizing that the process is underway, continue to collaborate with potential partners to develop “road maps” for fish passage restoration in different situations (MoT roads, rail lines, permit roads of different usages, FSRs, etc.) – documenting the people that need be involved, discussions and process that are undertaken, funding options, etc.
 * Develop threshold for barrier status of road-stream crossing structures that is specific to adult resident and fluvial westslope cutthrout trout so that impacts to potential spawning habitat connectivity can be quantified.
 * Work with representatives from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy to pull currently unavailable historical electrofishing data from the provincial Fisheries Information Summary System to determine catch per unit effort by species, area of habitat surveyed and timed electrofishing effort for sites within the study area. Results should be overlaid onto GIS (size/elevation of the watershed, length of modelled upstream channel, channel gradient, substrate type, etc.) to model historic species specific fish densities upstream and downstream of culvert locations.  Results can be utilized to assess likely carrying capacity of specific habitats potentially blocked by road-stream crossing structures, assess impacts of stream crossings on associated fish populations and quantify the value of crossing remediation based on cost estimates for remediation and potential gains in fish densities upstream due to the works.  
  * Continue to develop `bcfishpass` to build a connectivity index for the study area watersheds to inform a connectivity remediation plan based on cost benefits for quantity of habitat restored and modelled population density benefits.
 * Acquisition of funding to procure site plans and replacement designs for structures identified as high priorities for restoration through this 2019/2020 phase of the project. 
 * Explore and pursue opportunities to obtain buy-in and funding for replacement of identified high priority structures.
 * Drafting and implementation of a collaborative plan for assessing the impacts of fish passage restoration investments.  The plan should be designed to provide data necessary to effectively monitor the outcomes of restoration efforts, inform future investments and build capacity/momentum for ecosystem restoration activities in the region.
