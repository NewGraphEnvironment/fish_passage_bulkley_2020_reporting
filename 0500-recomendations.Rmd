# Recommendations

Recommended next steps for fish passage restoration in the Elk River watershed group include:


 * Continue to collaborate with potential partners to build relationships, explore perspectives and develop “road maps” for fish passage restoration in different situations (MoT roads, rail lines, permit roads of different usages, FSRs, etc.) – documenting the people involved, discussions and process that are undertaken, funding options, etc.
 * Continue to develop `bcfishpass` and build a connectivity index for the study area watersheds to inform a connectivity remediation plan.
 * Acquire funding to procure site plans and replacement designs for structures identified as high priorities for restoration. 
 * Conduct fish passage and habitat confirmation assessments at road and rail stream crossings identified as high and moderate priorities in the Elk and Flathead River study areas through this project and future connectivity modelling analysis.
 * Refine passability thresholds for road-stream crossing structures to explore metrics specific to life stage and life history for westslope cutthrout trout to focus quantification of impacts of structures on connectivity within spawning and/or rearing habitats.
 * Work with regulators, the Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Management Framework Working Group and others to explore previously developed habitat suitablity indices for westslope cutthrout trout in the region as well as to analyze historic electrofishing data to determine catch per unit effort by species, area of habitat surveyed and timed electrofishing effort for sites within the study area. Results should be overlaid onto GIS (size/elevation of the watershed, length of modelled upstream channel, channel gradient, substrate type, etc.) to model species specific fish densities in habitats similiar to those found upstream and downstream of culvert locations.  This will facilitate estimations of the carrying capacities of habitats potentially blocked by road-stream crossing structures, allowing assessment of impacts of stream crossings on associated fish populations and quantification of the value of crossing remediations. 
 * Drafting and implementation of a collaborative plan for assessing the impacts of fish passage restoration investments.  The plan should be designed to provide data necessary to effectively monitor the outcomes of restoration efforts, inform future investments and build capacity/momentum for ecosystem restoration activities in the region.
