# Recommendations

Recommended next steps for fish passage restoration in the Elk River watershed group include:


 * Continue to collaborate with potential partners to develop “road maps” for fish passage restoration in different situations (MoT roads, rail lines, permit roads of different usages, FSRs, etc.) – documenting the people that need be involved, discussions and process that are undertaken, funding options, etc.

  * Continue to develop `bcfishpass` to build a connectivity index for the study area watersheds to inform a connectivity remediation plan based on cost benefits for quantity of habitat restored and modelled population density benefits.
 * Acquisition of funding to procure site plans and replacement designs for structures identified as high priorities for restoration through this 2020 phase of the project. 
 * Explore and pursue opportunities to obtain buy-in and funding for replacement of identified high priority structures.
 * Conduct fish passage and habitat confirmation assessments at road and rail stream crossings identified as high and moderate priorities in the Elk and Flathead River study areas through this project and through Canadian Wildlife Federation connectivity modelling analysis.
 * Refine passability thresholds for road-stream crossing structures to explore metrics specific to adult resident and fluvial westslope cutthrout trout to help quantify impacts of barriers on adult fish access to spawning habitat.
 * Work with representatives from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, and the Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Management Framework Working Group to pull and refine currently unavailable historical electrofishing data from provincial databases to determine catch per unit effort by species, area of habitat surveyed and timed electrofishing effort for sites within the study area. Results can be overlaid onto GIS (size/elevation of the watershed, length of modelled upstream channel, channel gradient, substrate type, etc.) to model species specific fish densities in habitats similiar to those found upstream and downstream of culvert locations.  Results can be utilized to assess likely carrying capacity of specific habitats potentially blocked by road-stream crossing structures, assess impacts of stream crossings on associated fish populations and quantify the value of crossing remediation based on cost estimates for remediation and potential gains in fish densities upstream due to the works. 
 * Drafting and implementation of a collaborative plan for assessing the impacts of fish passage restoration investments.  The plan should be designed to provide data necessary to effectively monitor the outcomes of restoration efforts, inform future investments and build capacity/momentum for ecosystem restoration activities in the region.
