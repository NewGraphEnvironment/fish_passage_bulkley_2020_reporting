## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on a `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` at km 31 of `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)`.  `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)` can be accessed from Summit Lake Rd East which meets Highway 16 approximately 11km east of Houston.  The culvert is located approximately 490m upstream from the confluence with McQuarrie Creek. `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)` is the responsibility of FLNR - Nadina Forest District.


<br>

## Background {-}


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` is a `r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(stream_order) %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r round(my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(watershed_upstr_ha)/100,1)`km^2^, containing an estimated `r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(total_wetland_ha)`ha of wetland and an additional`r  my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha of lakes. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1200m to 935m at PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`. Upstream of `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)`, no fish have been previously recorded. Downstream in McQuarrie Creek ,`r my_fish_sp(df = bcfishpass_all, sit = 3143)` have been recorded.  Although steelhead have been noted near the downstream confluence of the subject stream and McQuarrie Creek in @data_fish_obs, @ncfdc1998MidBulkleyDetailed note a 4-5 m impassable falls (significant overhanging section, lack of plunge pool) exists in the 
canyon in reach 2 (UTM 9.662200.6045550).   

<br>


Beginning in 2016 the BC Ministry of Forests, Land, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRORD), Land and Water Section established a continuous discharge monitoring station on McQuarrie Creek just upstream of the highway [@westcott2020UpperBulkley]. Additionally, three water temperature sensors have been deployed in the watershed.  One is located in McQuarrie Creek just above Highway 16, another is in McQuarrie Creek above North Road and one is in McQuarrie Lake [@westcott2020UpperBulkley]. Sensors in McQuarrie Creek have been gathering water temperature data at 1hour intervals since 2015 and the sensor in McQuarrie Lake is gathering maximum temperature information form 1m below the surface since July 2018.  Data from the two McQuarrie Creek temperature monitoring stations is available through the Skeena Salmon Data Centre [@dfo/flnro2019WaterTemperaturea; @dfo/flnro2019WaterTemperatureb]. 

<br>


The McQuarrie Creek watershed has been selected as a focus watershed for Environmental Stewardship Initiative (ESI) research including critical flow monitoring, benthic invertebrate sampling, water quality monitoring and fisheries assessments (pers. comm Don Morgan, Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy).

<br>

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a high priority for follow up in @irvine2018AnalysisPriority and as McQuarrie Creek was noted as an important rearing area for steelhead by @tredger1982UpperBulkleyand the because the subject stream was lake headed which can stabilize flows in the system.  and because engagement activities with Wet'suwet'en, FLNRO and Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy representatives indicated that there could be potential efficiencies by overlapping fish passage assessment/remediation/monitoring in ESI watersheds.An erronous input into the provincial database for PSCIS crossing 3138 indicated that the oval culvert structure located on McQuarrie Creek just upstream of the confluence with the subject stream was an open bottomed structure and fully passable.  @ncfdc1998MidBulkleyDetailed noted that this culvert  was a barrier to upstream fish passage at lows, was undersized for high flow periods and was causing fill slope erosion at the road crossing. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r my_mapsheet()`).

<br>


## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

At the time of the survey, the culvert under `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@fish_passage_assessments]. The pipe was `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m in diameter with a length of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`%, a stream width ratio of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_width_ratio)` and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-3139)). Water temperature was `r my_habitat_info3(row = 'temperature c')`$^\circ$C, pH was `r my_habitat_info3(row = 'p h')` and conductivity was `r my_habitat_info3(row = 'conductivity m s cm')`uS/cm.

my_priority <-  my_priority_info()

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m to the confluence with Buck Creek `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-3139-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-3139-02))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-3139-d1))"))`. Total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-3139)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'average gradient percent')`%. The dominant substrate was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material dominant")` with `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material subdominant")` subdominant. A fish (130mm) was observed in the culvert outlet pool and a substance suspected to be didymo was noted on the substrate.  The habitat was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>%  pull(hab_value)` value as it was considered an important migration corridor with habitat suitable for fry and juvenile salmonid rearing. 

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {-}

The stream was surveyed immediately upstream from `r as.character(my_site)` for approximately `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-3139-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-3139-04))")} else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-3139-d2))"))`. Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-3139)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  The dominant substrate was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = "bed material dominant")` with `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = "bed material subdominant")` subdominant. Rare pockets of gravel suitable for spawning resident, fluvial and anadromous salmonids were noted. The stream appeared to be aggraded with side bars common.  One salmonid (110mm) was observed just upstream of `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)`. Habitat value was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` value with moderate rearing potential for fry and juvenile salmonids. 

<br>

One crossing (PSCIS 197647) was assessed on an upstream tributary crossed by the Carrier FSR (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197647)).  This tributary that enters the subject stream approximately 3.3km upstream of `r as.character(my_site)`, was dry at the time of the survey and did not provide any viable fish habitat. Numerous fish inventory sample sites were located downstream of the location of 197647 within the adjacent tributary to the subject stream with no fish observations recorded in two seasons of sampling [@moeStreamInventorySample].

<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge (`r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000, big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_net))` linear m/\$1000 and `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_area_net))`m^2^/\$1000.


<br>


## Conclusion {-}

A conservative estimate of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(upstream_habitat_length_km)`km to the top end of a 71ha wetland where rainbow trout have been recorded. Habitat in the areas surveyed upstream of the culvert were rated as `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing with areas of wetland habitat likely suitable for rainbow trout, coho and steelhead rearing. `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)` is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.  The crossing was ranked as a `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.
