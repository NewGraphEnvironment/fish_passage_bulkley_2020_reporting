## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and 62424 are located on `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)`, approximately `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m and 185m upstream from where Grave Creek splits into two channels with the majority of flow continuing up  the valley in an east then south-east direction.  Of note, although the subject stream is labelled as Grave Creek in the freshwater atlas the majority of stream flow is located in the other previously mentioned channel.  Also of relevance, the confluence of Grave Creek and the other channel is located approximately 175 to the west of where the confluence is mapped in the freshwater stream atlas due to the channel jumping its banks approximatley 375m upstream. Three PSCIS crossings (62427, 62428 and 62429) and one unassessed modelled crossing (modelled ID 4601159) are located upstream of 62424 however, there are very minimal quantities of potential habitat modelled upstream of their locations. Although mapped within the digital road atlas and not the forest tenure road layer it is suspected that the road on which both culverts are located is a Canfor Forest Products Ltd. forest tenure road as it is located immediately adjacent to another forest tenure road and is within an area that appears to be utilized for logging related activities.

## Background {-}

Grave Creek is known to contain westslope cutthrout trout and bull trout downstream of the subject culverts and westslope cutthrout trout above [@data_fish_obs]. Two habitat confirmation assessments were conducted downstream on the mainstem of Grave Creek in 2014 at PSCIS crossings 62421 and 62422 [@masseEKConfirmation2015]. Although @masseEKConfirmation2015 recommended the culverts be left in place, based on consultation with Heather Lamson (MoE Fisheries Biologist), to prevent potential hybridization of westslope cutthrout trout upstream of the barrier with stocked rainbow trout reported in lower Grave Creek, both structures had been replaced with bridges at the time of the surveys. Designs and remediations of these crossings was not recorded in the PSCIS. Reassessments of these crossings was conducted by our team in 2020 and results will be loaded to PSCIS. 

<br>

PSCIS stream crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and 62424 were ranked as a moderate priorities for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the relatively large size of the stream network upstream (3.5km) and because they contained habitat rated as moderate value habitat by @vastFishPassage2013. There is a bridge (PSCIS 197566) located on the Lazy Lizard recreation trail approximatley 350m upstream of the crossing and an unassessed modelled crossing (modelled ID 4600929) approximately 950m upstream.  Downstream approximately 400m there is a foot bridge (PSCIS 197544) on a recreational hiking/biking trail.  The habitat confirmation was completed on `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(date) %>% format(., format = "%B %d, %Y")`. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1 â€“ Map [`r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(map_tile_display_name)`](`r my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

Th culvert located at PSCIS `r as.character(my_site)` appeared to have been replaced in 2020 with fresh rock and road fill present.  At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and non-backwatered `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m diameter crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a pipe length of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`%, a stream width ratio of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_width_ratio)` and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-624230)). Water temperature was `r my_habitat_info() %>% filter(rowname == 'temperature c') %>% pull(us)`$^\circ$C, pH was `r my_habitat_info() %>% filter(rowname == 'p h') %>% pull(us)` and conductivity was `r my_habitat_info() %>% filter(rowname == 'conductivity m s cm') %>% pull(us)`uS/cm.

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m to Lizard Creek. Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-624230), Figure \@ref(fig:photo-62423-01)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  The dominant substrate was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material dominant")` with `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material subdominant")` subdominant. Adjacent to the historic road, on the right bank of stream, there was very limited shrub and tree riparian vegetation. Downstream of the crossing there were frequent sections of gravels suitable for salmonid spawning and no barriers or obstacles to fish passage. Habitat was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>%  pull(hab_value)` value for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing.  

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {-}

The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m. Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-62423), Figure \@ref(fig:photo-62423-02)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  There were abundant gravels suitable for resident westslope cutthrout trout spawning throughout (Figure \@ref(fig:photo-62423-03)).  Fry were observed within the area surveyed to 540m upstream of the culvert where gradients increased to >20% for a distance of approximately 15m.  Although no sampling was conducted, no fish were observed above this high gradient section. Habitat value was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Structure replacement with a bridge is recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`.  The cost for the work is estimated at \$`r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000)` for a cost benefit of \$`r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_net) * 1000)`/linear m and \$`r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_area_net) * 1000)`/m^2^.


## Conclusion {-}

There is `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with habitat rated as high value for fry and juvenile salmonid rearing. The road may be part of the Island Lake Recreational tenure or solely the responsiblity of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations & Rural Development. The crossing was ranked as a `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.
