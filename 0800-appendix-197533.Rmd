## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located north of Sparwood, BC on `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)`, approximately 600m and 725m upstream from the Elk River.  During our 2020 surveys two fords (PSCIS 197535 and 197536) were documented 700m and 2km upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` respectively.  Although several un-assessed crossings are modelled upstream of Ford 197536, review of aerial imagery indicates that the only crossing on the mainstem of Brule Creek is a bridge (modelled crossing 24706664) and the remaining crossings are modelled on small and/or very steep tributaries streams only and unlikely to be blocking access to significant amounts of important habitat. Both Busato Road and Highway 43 are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.   


<br>

## Background {-}


At the crossing locations, Brule Creek is a 5th order stream with a watershed area upstream of the road of approximately 87km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 2800 to 1200m at  PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`. Brule Creek is known to contain westslope cutthrout trout, rainbow trout and bull trout downstream and upstream of the subject culverts [@data_fish_obs]. On the south side of the watershed at an elevation of 2000m is Josephine Lake (A.K.A. Big Lake) which is 5ha in area.  Although the lake contained no fish in a biophysical inventory in 1983, it was stocked with westslope cutthrout trout from 1983 - 2000 [@data_fish_obs; @FishInventoriesData2020].

<br>

PSCIS stream crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` were ranked as high priorities for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the large size of the stream network upstream (`r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(wct_network_km)`km) and because Brule Creek is a 5th order stream. The habitat confirmation was completed on `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(date) %>% format(., format = "%B %d, %Y")`. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1 â€“ Map [`r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(map_tile_display_name)`](`r my_mapsheet()`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

At the time of the survey, both culverts were un-embedded, non-backwatered and considered barriers to upstream fish passage. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m in diameter with a pipe length of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`%, a stream width ratio of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_width_ratio)` and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197533)). PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was `r my_pscis_info(site = my_site2) %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m in diameter with a pipe length of `r my_pscis_info(site = my_site2) %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info(site = my_site2) %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`%, a stream width ratio of `r my_pscis_info(site = my_site2) %>% pull(stream_width_ratio)` and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info(site = my_site2) %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197559)). Water temperature was `r my_habitat_info() %>% filter(rowname == 'temperature c') %>% pull(us)`$^\circ$C, pH was `r my_habitat_info() %>% filter(rowname == 'p h') %>% pull(us)` and conductivity was `r my_habitat_info() %>% filter(rowname == 'conductivity m s cm') %>% pull(us)`uS/cm.

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of `r as.character(my_site)` {-}

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m to where the stream joins the flow entering the valley from the south. Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197533), Figure \@ref(fig:photo-197533-01)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  The dominant substrate was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material dominant")` with `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material subdominant")` subdominant.  Downstream of the crossing there were frequent sections of gravels suitable for salmonid spawning and no barriers or obstacles to fish passage. Habitat was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>%  pull(hab_value)` value for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing.  

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site)` and Downstream of `r as.character(my_site2)`{-}

The stream was surveyed upstream from `r as.character(my_site)` for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m to `r as.character(my_site2)`. Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197533), Figure \@ref(fig:photo-197533-02)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  There were abundant gravels suitable for resident westslope cutthrout trout spawning throughout (Figure \@ref(fig:photo-197533-03)).  Some debris jam steps to 0.8m in height were observed and there were approximately 15 westslope cutthrout trout (approximately 170mm long) in the outlet pool for crossing `r as.character(my_site2)`. Habitat value was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing. 


<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of `r as.character(my_site2)`{-}

The stream was surveyed upstream from `r as.character(my_site2)` for `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m. Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(sit = my_site2,, loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197533), Figure \@ref(fig:photo-197533-02)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us', row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  This stream channel showed evidence of recent disturbance with eroding banks, multiple channels and aggraded sections throughout.  Steps (0.6 - 0.9m in height) due to large woody debris debris jams were frequent throughout surveyed area and at a point approximately 200 m upstream of the road-stream crossing to the top end of the area surveyed, cover was limited to sporadic pools up to 0.3m deep. As mentioned previously, the historic channel was abandoned at 175m upstream of `r as.character(my_site2)` (UTM: 11 U 661748 5524558, Figure \@ref(fig:photo-197533-03)) with no flow observed within its banks. One of the tributaries that enters Grave Creek approximately 250m upstream of `r as.character(my_site2)` was accessed off of an adjacent spur road with a raped assessment conducted 250m upstream from the confluence with Grave Creek (UTM: 11U 662083 5524708).  The average channel width at this location was 1.9m and the average gradient was 9%.  Immediately upstream, the gradient in this tributary was 20% representing grades not likely  passable for westslope cutthrout trout migrting upstream. Overall, habitat value upstream of `r as.character(my_site2)` within the mainstem of Grave Creek was rated as `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` with moderate rearing potential for fry/juvenile westslope cutthrout trout.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Replacing PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and 197533 with bridges is recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream.  The costs are estimated at \$`r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000)` and \$`r as.character(my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2) %>% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000)` respectively for a combined cost benefit of `r paste0('$', as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_net) * 1000 + my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2) %>% pull(cost_net) * 1000))`/linear m and \$`r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_area_net) * 1000  + my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2) %>% pull(cost_area_net) * 1000)`/m^2^.



## Conclusion {-}

There is `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with habitat rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` value for fry and juvenile salmonid rearing and another `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site2) %>% pull(upstream_habitat_length_km)`km upstream of `r as.character(my_site2)` rated as `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)`. Although mapped within the digital road atlas it is suspected that the road on which both culverts are located is a forest tenure road (Canfor Forest Products Ltd. permit) as it is located immediately adjacent to another forest tenure road under permit to Canfor and within an area utilized for forestry. If this is the case, the underlying responsibility for the road belongs to the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development with Canfor responsible for maintenance and upgrades. The crossing was ranked as `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.
