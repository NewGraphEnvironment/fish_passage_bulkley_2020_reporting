## Site Location {-}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` on `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)` approximately from Houston, BC and approximatley 1km upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)` is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

##idon't think we need this here but...
#During 2020 surveys, PSCIS culvert 197669 was documented on `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)`, 1.2km upstream of the FSR.

```

<br>

## Background {-}


`r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` drains one of the largest tributary watersheds in the upper Bulkley River.  At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` is a `r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(stream_order) %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r round(my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(watershed_upstr_ha)/100,1)`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1660 to 680m at PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`. Upstream of the highway, `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)` is known to contain coho, chinook, steelhead, rainbow trout, longnose dace and longnose sucker [@data_fish_obs]. A bridge (modelled crossing 1805593) is located under the railway approximately 830m downstream of the crossing which is reported by @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage to constrict the channel.  Although numerous modelled crossings are located upstream of the highway an impassable waterfall is located approximately 2km upstream of the highway (pers. comm. Jonathan Van Barneveld, Forester - FLNR).


<br>

In the summer of 1998,  the Nadina Community Futures Development Corporation (NCFDC) contracted the Britis Columbia Conservation Foundation to carry out a detailed Level 1 Fish, Fish Habitat and Riparian Assessment in Richfield Creek and several other large Upper Bulkley River tributary streams.  Building on these assessments and detailed fish sampling, @ncfdc1998MidBulkleyDetailed developed restoration prescriptions for the lower reaches of the watershed were developed based on the following assessment of impacts:

 * loss of riparian forest and soil compaction in areas used for agriculture, the powerline corridor, transportation corridors and at housing developments within the floodplain.
 * loss of the shrub/herb layer and soil compaction from cattle grazing where overstory still present.
 * removal of large woody debris which controls lateral channel movement and plant community distribution on the floodplain.
 
 <br>
 
A water temperature monitoring station has been operational on Richfield Creek just upstream of the highway since November 2014 and a continuous water level monitoring station is proposed on the stream [@westcott2020UpperBulkley].


<br>


Although in 2007, @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage reported that fish passage at `r as.character(my_site)` was not hindered by the culverts at that time the site was rated as a priority for follow up following background review and a Phase 1 assessment in 2020 indicating that the crossing was not passable according to provincial metrics and due to the presence of significant quantities of upstream habitat suitable for salmonid rearing and spawning. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r my_bcfishpass() %>% pull(dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r my_mapsheet()`).


## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {-}

At the time of the survey, the two culverts under Highway 16 were un-embedded, non-backwatered and considered a barrier to upstream fish passage. The pipes were `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m in diameter with lengths of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`%, a stream width ratio of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_width_ratio)` and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-197662)). Water temperature was `r my_habitat_info() %>% filter(rowname == 'temperature c') %>% pull(us)`$^\circ$C, pH was `r my_habitat_info() %>% filter(rowname == 'p h') %>% pull(us)` and conductivity was `r my_habitat_info() %>% filter(rowname == 'conductivity m s cm') %>% pull(us)`uS/cm.  


<br>

```{r eval=F}
##this is useful to get some comments for the report
hab_site %>% filter(site == my_site & location == 'us') %>% pull(comments)
my_priority <-  my_priority_info()

```

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {-}

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197662-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197662-02))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197662-d1))"))`. Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'ds') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197662)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = 'average gradient percent')`%. The dominant substrate was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material dominant")` with `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'ds', row = "bed material subdominant")` subdominant. Habitat was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') %>%  pull(hab_value)` as it was considered an important migration corridor with moderate value habitat for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing.  

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {-}

The stream was surveyed upstream from `r as.character(my_site)` for `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(survey_length_m)`m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197662-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197662-04))")} else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197662-d2))"))`. Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(v)` with  `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info2(loc = 'us') %>% filter(v == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197662)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg channel width m')`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'avg wetted width m')`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info3(loc = 'us', row = 'average gradient percent')`%.  Habitat value was rated as `r my_priority_info(loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` for salmonid rearing and spawning. 


<br>

PSCIS culvert `r as.character(my_site2)` was documented on `r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(stream_name)`, 500m upstream on Highway 16. The culvert has been newly replaced and is baffled with a natural type substrate throughout.  Although ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage using the provincial metric the crossing is likely not a barrier during most flows for adult anadromous salmon and fluvial salmonids migrating upstream from the Bulkley River. The pipe was `r my_pscis_info(dat = pscis_all, site = my_site2) %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m in diameter with a pipe length of `r my_pscis_info(dat = pscis_all, site = my_site2) %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info(dat = pscis_all, site = my_site2) %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`%, a stream width ratio of `r my_pscis_info(dat = pscis_all, site = my_site2) %>% pull(stream_width_ratio)` and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info(dat = pscis_all, site = my_site2) %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-58158)).

<br>


## Fish Sampling {-}

To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fisheries values in the stream, minnowtrapping was conducted with three traps set overnight upstream as well as downstream of the crossing.  A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds') & species_code == 'CO') %>% pull(count_fish)` coho and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds') & species_code == 'RB') %>% pull(count_fish)` were captured downstream.  Only rainbow trout (`r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us') & species_code == 'RB') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish) were captured upstream (Table \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-197662) and `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-197662-05) - \\@ref(fig:photo-197662-06))")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197662-d03))"))`.


<br>

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {-}

Structure replacement with a bridge (`r my_pscis_info() %>% pull(recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m span) is recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`. The cost of the work is estimated at \$`r format(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_est_1000s) * 1000, big.mark = ',')` for a cost benefit of `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_net))` linear m/\$1000 and `r as.character(my_cost_estimate() %>% pull(cost_area_net))`m^2^/\$1000.


<br>


## Conclusion {-}

There is `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`.  Habitat in this area was rated as `r my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us') %>% pull(hab_value)` value for salmonid rearing/spawning.  `r my_overview_info() %>% pull(road_name)` is on private land owned by the Woodmere Nursury.  The crossing was ranked as a `r my_priority_info() %>% pull(priority)` priority for proceeding to design for replacement.
