Workflows for [Fish Passage and Habitat Confirmation Assessments](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/fish/aquatic-habitat-management/fish-passage/fish-passage-technical) conducted in the Elk River watershed upstream of the Elko Dam near Fernie in the summer/fall of 2020.

This repository builds an [interactive report](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_elk_2020_reporting_cwf/) that is in the early stages of development, is incomplete and may contain errors.  It is updated regularly and will change substantially with much more detail yet to be added.   Please contact al@newgraphenvironment.com (2507771518) with any feedback regarding any of the fish passage restoration candidate sites or if you have any questions regarding the project.  Thank you for taking the time to review.

 * The report is generated from scratch from a Rmarkdown document processing raw data from:
 
    + [Checklist for Habitat Confirmation](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/fish/aquatic-habitat-management/fish-passage/fish-passage-technical/habitat-confirmation-projects) procedures developed by the provincial [Fish Passage Technical Working Group](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/fish/aquatic-habitat-management/fish-passage/fish-passage-technical) to guide biologists confirming fish habitat value at a stream crossing which has been identified as a potential high‚Äêpriority restoration site.

    + [Fish Data Submission Spreadsheet Template - V 2.0, January 20, 2020 ](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/fish/fish-and-fish-habitat-data-information/fish-data-submission/submit-fish-data#submitfish)

    + Excel spreadsheet with priority level detailed for each of the crossings surveyed with Phase 2 assessments as well as details on the length of the surey and a conservative estimate of habitat suitable for fish species located upstream of the crossing.

    + GPS tracks and points from field surveys.  

    + Photos and photo metadata.
