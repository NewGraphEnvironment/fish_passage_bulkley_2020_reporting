<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern BC undertook an initiative in April of 2020 to plan and conduct fish passage restoration planning activities in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups which are sub-basins of the Skeena River watershed. The initiative was supported by a grant from the Habitat Conservation Trust Fund that leveraged funding committed in the fall of 2019 from the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and the Canadian Wildlife Federation. New Graph Environment and Hillcrest Geographics were subcontracted to complete the work which included updating and implementation of GIS analysis tools used to quantify potential habitat gains of fish passage restoration for target species as well as on the ground fish passage assessments and habitat confirmation assessments. In August of 2020, following a province wide prioritization exercise and a series of workshops, the Canadian Wildlife Federation selected the Bulkley River watershed group as a target watershed for connectivity planning efforts supported by a grant from the British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund. Recognizing synergies between the two initiatives, project activities of both initiatives became a collaboration between SERNbc and CWF with extensive input from numerous organizations and individuals connected to the watershed. Although fish passage restoration planning was conducted for both the Morice River watershed group and the Bulkley River watershed group, on the ground surveys in 2020 focused primarily within Bulkley River tributaries.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat <span class="citation">(Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015)</span>. Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues <span class="citation">(Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005)</span>. As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement and deactivation designs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Although remediation and replacement of crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant, impacts of the work often complex to isolate/quantify and outside investments in infrastructure on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical from all perspectives. When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising for ecosystem restoration activities, cost benefits and the ethics of fish passage investments should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative restoration activities (ex. transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, etc.). A Fish Passage Working Group consisting of First Nations, non-profits, stakeholder groups and regulators has been established for the Bulkley River through a connectivity planning initiative spearheaded by the Canadian Wildlife Federation. At the time of reporting, collaborative decision making processes regarding connectivity issues were underway through monthly meetings with results forthcoming in a watershed connectivity remediation plan. At the time of reporting, the scope of connectivity planning explored by the Working Group included the Bulkley River watershed group and not yet the Morice River and other sub-basins of the Skeena River watershed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Fish passage restoration planning for the Morice River watershed was informed by engagement with the Office of Wet’suwet’en, the Morice Watershed Monitoring Trust and numerous others along with the application of the open-source <code>bcfishpass</code> tools which were utilized to analyze potential habitat gains of remediation activities based on species and life stage specific habitat characteristics. online interactive and georeferenced field maps were produced and a field plan for future on the ground assessments formulated. Some key areas targeted for future fieldwork activity include assessments within the Owen Creek, Lamprey Creek, McBride/Morice Lake etc (placeholder).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During 2020 fieldwork, a total of 31 fish passage assessments were conducted with 13 crossings considered “passable”, 3 crossings considered “potential” barriers and 15 crossings considered “barriers” according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 23 sites with a total of approximately 18 km of stream assessed. Twelve crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 9 crossings were rated as moderate priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 2 crossings were rated as a low priority.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recommendations for potential incorporation into collaborative watershed connectivity planning for the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue to develop <code>bcfishpass</code> and other open source tools that are scalable, facilitate reproducible analysis and can be adapted to incorporate alternative fragmentation indicators and habitat gain/value metrics.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to conduct fish passage and habitat confirmation assessments at road and rail stream crossings at sites in the study areas prioritized through this project and future connectivity analysis/modelling. In the Bulkley River watershed group, particular sites of note where future Phase 1 and Phase 2 assessments are recommended include John Brown Creek, Toboggan Creek, Cesford Creek, Watson Creek and Ailport Creek.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to acquire funding to procure site plans and replacement designs for structures collaboratively identified as high priorities for restoration. Explore cost benefits and ethics of fish passage investments alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative restoration activities (ex. land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Refine barrier thresholds for road-stream crossing structures to explore metrics specific to life stage and life history types of species of interest. This will further focus efforts of potential remediation actions based on biological attributes (ex. timing of migration, size/direction of fish migrating, etc.) and could result in the consideration of interim “stop-gap” physical works to alter crossing characteristics that can be significantly less costly than structure replacements (ex. building up of downstream area with rock riffles to decrease the outlet drop size and/or increaseing water depth within pipe with baffles and substrate additions).</p></li>
<li><p>Model fish densities (fish/m<sup>2</sup>) vs. habitat/water quality characteristics (i.e. gradient, watershed size, channel size, alkalinity, elevation, etc.) using historically gathered electrofishing data to inform crossing prioritization and the monitoring of subsequent restoration actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Expand the scope of the working group to include the entire Skeena River watershed. A Skeena level effort will facilitate a more inclusive decision making environment, open up opportunities for collaboration/funding to more governments/organizations/stakeholders and allow consideration of all potential remediation sites that could benefit Skeena fish populations.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to collaborate with potential partners to build relationships, explore perspectives and develop “road maps” for fish passage restoration in different situations (MoT roads, rail lines, permit roads of different usages, FSRs, etc.) – documenting the people involved, discussions and processes that are undertaken, funding options, synergies, measures of success, etc. Through this collaboration such as is occurring with the Bulkley River working group, continue to draft and implement plans for fish passage restoration investments as well as to monitor the impacts of those investments on fish populations.</p></li>
