The work was carried out in accordance with the BC Ministry of Environment: Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage at Closed Bottom Structures, 4th Edition (BC Ministry of Environment 2011) and Fish Passage Strategic Approach: Protocol for Prioritizing Sites for Fish Passage Remediation: 4th Edition (Fish Passage Technical Working Group 2014). The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997). Reconnection of fragmented habitats is a management action that can generate some of the highest ecological returns on economic investments relative to other habitat restoration techniques (Saldi-Caromile et al. 2004). "],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Project Location 2.2 Fisheries", " 2 Background As a result of high-level direction from the provincial government, a Fish Passage Strategic Approach protocol has been developed for British Columbia to ensure that the greatest opportunities for restoration of fish passage are pursued. A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2014) : Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment  Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity. Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation  Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation. Phase 3: Design  Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. Phase 4: Remediation  Reconnection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. The scope of 2020/2021 project activities reported on in this document includes planning for and implementation of the first phase of fish passage assessment in the Elk River watershed upstream of the Elko Dam. 2.1 Project Location The project was focused within the upper Elk River watershed upstream of the Elko Dam located at Elko, BC. 2.2 Fisheries "],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Planning 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments 3.3 Barrier Scoreing 3.4 Cost Benefit Analysis 3.5 Habitat Gain Index", " 3 Methods 3.1 Planning We produced detailed maps of the project area identifying all locations where 1:20,000 scale TRIM map streams where intersected with roads. To determine target field sites we reviewed background habitat confirmation reports from (Masse Environmental Consultants Ltd. 2015) which crossings on fish habitat with significant quantities of fish habitat upstream had not yet been assessed, we used the Fish Habitat Model to the estimate the quantity and quality of fish habitat potentially upstream of crossings. Using the criteria below we screen previously cross reference modelled crossing locations with sites already within the Provincial Stream Crossing Summary System. Target crossings were identified as previously unnassessed crossings on streams with likely significant quantities of fish habitat upstream. 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments In the field, crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered other (fords, weirs, etc.). Six digit numerical crossing identifiers were generated for each crossings modeled. Crossings identified in the field that had no corresponding GIS generated ID were given unique identifiers beginning with the date in YYYYMMDD format appended with an identifier between 1 and 10 (ex. 2020091601). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any relevant features. Additionally, the following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed full assessment was completed for all closed bottom structures. Full assessments also included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.1). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data (see section 2.3.2), a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. All field data collected including photos were uploaded to the Provincial Stream Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). Table 3.1: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). 3.3 Barrier Scoreing Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure on fish bearing and potentially fish bearing stream reaches. The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table 3.2, Table 3.3. These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013).

Cumlative Score Result 0-14 passable 15-19 potential barrier &gt;20 barrier 3.4 Cost Benefit Analysis A cost benefit analysis was conducted for each crossing considered a barrier based on the amount of potential habitat to be made available by remediating fish passage at the site and an estimate of associated costs. 3.5 Habitat Gain Index The habitat gain index is the quantity of modelled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing. For this project we set the threshold between fish and non-fish habitat at a gradient of 20% representing the gradient limit accessible to downstream populations. A net value for the index used meaning that if there is a documented PSCIS barrier crossing upstream of the subject crossing or a modelled unassessed crossing the amount of habitat is totaled to that point. Potential options to remediate fish passage included: removal of the structure, backwatering Cost estimates for structure replacement were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill and the road type. Base costs for installation of bridges and embedded culverts were estimated based on interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay and Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group. Costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads was estimated at $12.5K/m and assumes that the road can be closed during construction. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m embedded culverts can be effective with installation costs estimated at $25k "],["results.html", "4 Results 4.1 Phase 1 4.2 Phase 2", " 4 Results 4.1 Phase 1 A total of XXX assessments were conducted between xxx and xxxxxxxxxx.

"],["appendix-crossing-50155.html", "Appendix - Crossing 50155 Site Location Background Stream Characteristics at Crossing Stream Characteristics Downstream Stream Characteristics Upstream Fish Sampling Conclusion", " Appendix - Crossing 50155 Island Lake Lodge Road - Tributary to Lizard Creek Site Location Crossing 50155 is located on a tributary to Lizard Creek, approximately 75m upstream from the confluence with Lizard Creek. The stream is located approximately 100m east of the location where it is mapped on the freshwater atlas stream layer. Island Lake Lodge Road is an extension of Mt.Fernie Park Road with access to Highway 3 located within Fernie city limits. The are is a popular recreational destination for hikers and mountain bikers. Island Lake Lodge is a year round tourist destination providing accomodations, guided hiking and backcountry catskiing for clients. Background At the crossing location, the stream is 2nd order with a watershed area upstream of the road of approximately 1.8km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1945m to 1080m at the culvert. One 12m long bridge (PSCIS 197543) is located upstream of the subject crossing approximately 575m on the Lazy Lizard bike trail and another 7m long bridge structure is located downstream also on a recreational trail. A search of provincial records yielded no fisheries information for the stream (MoE 2020b). Downstream, Lizard Creek supports westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, mountain whitefish, brook trout, longnose sucker and longnose dace (MoE 2020a). PSCIS stream crossing 50155 was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the large size of the stream relative to other tributary streams in the watershed, the previously rated high value habitat and because it was prioritized for follow up by VAST Resource Solutions Inc. (2013). The habitat confirmation was completed on September 22, 2020. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1  Map 082G.113. Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and non-backwatered 0.9m diameter crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a pipe length of 11m, a culvert slope of 2.6%, a stream width ratio of 2.5 an outlet drop of 0.22m (Table ??. Water temperature was 9\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.7 and conductivity was 480uS/cm. Stream Characteristics Downstream The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 100m to Lizard Creek. Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and overhanging vegetation (Figures 5.2). The average channel width was 2.2m, the average wetted width was 1.9m and the average gradient was 4.3%. Habitat value was rated as medium with good potential for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing but a lack of deep pools for adult overwintering and rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for 700m. Overall, total cover amount was rated as abundant with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, boulders, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation (Figure 5.3). The average channel width was 2.2m, the average wetted width was 1.6m and the average gradient was 10.5%. There were frequent areas of gravels suitable for resident westslope cutthrout trout spawning. Frequent pools to 40cm deep were present and associated with small and large woody debris. Habitat value was rated as high for fry and juvenile westslope cutthrout rearing. Fish Sampling To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fish densities in the stream we electrofished upstream and downstream of the crossing. Three sites were sampled upstream and one site was sampled downstream. A total of 42 westslope cutthrout trout and 4 eastern brook trout were captured upstream with 28 westslope cutthrout trout and 2 eastern brook trout captured downstream. Raw results are included in digital format as Attachment 2 and summarized in Tables 5.1 - 5.2 and Figure 5.1. Conclusion There is an estimated NAkm of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing 50155 with habitat in the areas surveyed upstream of the crossing rated as high value for fry and juvenile salmonid rearing. Although it could be partially attributed to the lower gradient habitat downstream and the proximity to the Lizard Creek mainstem, fish sampling results indicated that the crossing is potentially negatively impacting habitat capacity upstream of the crossing as higher densities of westslope cutthrout trout were captured downstream of the crossing than above. It is unclear whether the road is part of the Island Lake Recreational tenure or solely the responsiblity of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations &amp; Rural Development. The crossing was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for an open bottomed replacement structure. Table 5.1: Electrofishing sites for PSCIS crossing 50155.
