The work was carried out in accordance with the BC Ministry of Environment: Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage at Closed Bottom Structures, 4th Edition (BC Ministry of Environment 2011) and Fish Passage Strategic Approach: Protocol for Prioritizing Sites for Fish Passage Remediation: 4th Edition (Fish Passage Technical Working Group 2014). The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997). Reconnection of fragmented habitats is a management action that can generate some of the highest ecological returns on economic investments relative to other habitat restoration techniques (Saldi-Caromile et al. 2004). "],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Project Location 2.2 Fisheries", " 2 Background As a result of high-level direction from the provincial government, a Fish Passage Strategic Approach protocol has been developed for British Columbia to ensure that the greatest opportunities for restoration of fish passage are pursued. A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2014) : Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment  Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity. Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation  Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation. Phase 3: Design  Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. Phase 4: Remediation  Reconnection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. The scope of 2020/2021 project activities reported on in this document includes planning for and implementation of the first phase of fish passage assessment in the Elk River watershed upstream of the Elko Dam. 2.1 Project Location The project was focused within the upper Elk River watershed upstream of the Elko Dam located at Elko, BC. 2.2 Fisheries "],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Planning 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments 3.3 Barrier Scoreing 3.4 Cost Benefit Analysis 3.5 Habitat Gain Index", " 3 Methods 3.1 Planning We produced detailed maps of the project area identifying all locations where 1:20,000 scale TRIM map streams where intersected with roads. To determine target field sites we reviewed background habitat confirmation reports from (Masse Environmental Consultants Ltd. 2015) which crossings on fish habitat with significant quantities of fish habitat upstream had not yet been assessed, we used the Fish Habitat Model to the estimate the quantity and quality of fish habitat potentially upstream of crossings. Using the criteria below we screen previously cross reference modelled crossing locations with sites already within the Provincial Stream Crossing Summary System. Target crossings were identified as previously unnassessed crossings on streams with likely significant quantities of fish habitat upstream. 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments In the field, crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered other (fords, weirs, etc.). Six digit numerical crossing identifiers were generated for each crossings modeled. Crossings identified in the field that had no corresponding GIS generated ID were given unique identifiers beginning with the date in YYYYMMDD format appended with an identifier between 1 and 10 (ex. 2020091601). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any relevant features. Additionally, the following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed full assessment was completed for all closed bottom structures. Full assessments also included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.1). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data (see section 2.3.2), a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. All field data collected including photos were uploaded to the Provincial Stream Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). Table 3.1: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). 3.3 Barrier Scoreing Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure on fish bearing and potentially fish bearing stream reaches. The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table 3.2, Table 3.3. These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013).

Cumlative Score Result 0-14 passable 15-19 potential barrier &gt;20 barrier 3.4 Cost Benefit Analysis A cost benefit analysis was conducted for each crossing considered a barrier based on the amount of potential habitat to be made available by remediating fish passage at the site and an estimate of associated costs. 3.5 Habitat Gain Index The habitat gain index is the quantity of modelled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing. For this project we set the threshold between fish and non-fish habitat at a gradient of 20% representing the gradient limit accessible to downstream populations. A net value for the index used meaning that if there is a documented PSCIS barrier crossing upstream of the subject crossing or a modelled unassessed crossing the amount of habitat is totaled to that point. Potential options to remediate fish passage included: removal of the structure, backwatering Cost estimates for structure replacement were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill and the road type. Base costs for installation of bridges and embedded culverts were estimated based on interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay and Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group. Costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads was estimated at $12.5K/m and assumes that the road can be closed during construction. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m embedded culverts can be effective with installation costs estimated at $25k "],["results.html", "4 Results 4.1 Phase 1 4.2 Phase 2", " 4 Results 4.1 Phase 1 A total of XXX assessments were conducted between xxx and xxxxxxxxxx.

The stream is located approximately 100m east of the location where it is mapped on the freshwater atlas stream layer. Island Lake Lodge Road is an extension of Mt.Fernie Park Road with access to Highway 3 located within Fernie city limits. The are is a popular recreational destination for hikers and mountain bikers. Island Lake Lodge is a year round tourist destination providing accomodations, guided hiking and backcountry catskiing for clients. Background At the crossing location, the stream is 2nd order with a watershed area upstream of the road of approximately 1.8km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1945m to 1080m at the culvert. One 12m long bridge (PSCIS 197543) is located upstream of the subject crossing approximately 575m on the Lazy Lizard bike trail and another 7m long bridge structure is located downstream also on a recreational trail. A search of provincial records yielded no fisheries information for the stream (MoE 2020c). Downstream, Lizard Creek supports westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, mountain whitefish, brook trout, longnose sucker and longnose dace (MoE 2020b). PSCIS stream crossing 50155 was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the large size of the stream relative to other tributary streams in the watershed, the previously rated high value habitat and because it was prioritized for follow up by VAST Resource Solutions Inc. (2013). The habitat confirmation was completed on September 22, 2020. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1  Map 082G.113. Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and non-backwatered 0.9m diameter crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a pipe length of 11m, a culvert slope of 2.6%, a stream width ratio of 2.5 an outlet drop of 0.22m (Table 5.1). Water temperature was 9\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.7 and conductivity was 480uS/cm. Stream Characteristics Downstream The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 100m to Lizard Creek. Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.6, Figure 5.2). The average channel width was 2.2m, the average wetted width was 1.9m and the average gradient was 4.3%. Habitat value was rated as medium with good potential for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing but a lack of deep pools for adult overwintering and rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for 700m. Overall, total cover amount was rated as abundant with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, boulders, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.6, Figure 5.3). The average channel width was 2.2m, the average wetted width was 1.6m and the average gradient was 10.5%. There were frequent areas of gravels suitable for resident westslope cutthrout trout spawning. Frequent pools to 40cm deep were present and associated with small and large woody debris. Habitat value was rated as high for fry and juvenile westslope cutthrout rearing. Fish Sampling To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fish densities in the stream we electrofished upstream and downstream of the crossing. Three sites were sampled upstream and one site was sampled downstream. A total of 42 westslope cutthrout trout and 4 eastern brook trout were captured upstream with 28 westslope cutthrout trout and 2 eastern brook trout captured downstream. Raw results are included in digital format as Attachment 2 and summarized in Tables 5.3 - 5.4 and Figure 5.1. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Structure replacement with an open bottomed culvert is recommended to provide unconstained access to the habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing 50155. The cost for work is estimated at $125000 for a cost benefit of $8700/linear m and $9700/m2. Conclusion There is an estimated 1.8km of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing 50155 with habitat in the areas surveyed upstream of the crossing rated as high value for fry and juvenile salmonid rearing. Although potentially attributable to the lower gradient habitat downstream and the proximity to the Lizard Creek mainstem, fish sampling results indicated that the crossing is potentially negatively impacting habitat capacity upstream of the crossing as higher densities of westslope cutthrout trout were captured downstream of the crossing than above. The road may be part of the Island Lake Recreational tenure or solely the responsiblity of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations &amp; Rural Development. The crossing was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement with an open bottomed structure. Table 5.1: Summary of fish passage reassessment for PSCIS crossing 50155.

This crossing has also been recorded in PSCIS as crossing 62510. Island Lake Lodge Road is an extension of Mt.Fernie Park Road which is accessed from Highway 3 within Fernie city limits. The area is a popular recreational destination for hikers and mountain bikers. Island Lake Lodge is located at 1400m of elevation near Island Lake and is a year round tourist destination providing accommodations, guided hiking and backcountry catskiing for clients. The subject stream is not mapped in the freshwater atlas stream layer and may have been diverted as part of a micro-hydro facilty for Island Lake Lodge. A small building that could be a generating station was observed on aerial imagery approximately 1500m upstream of the road. Background At the crossing location, the stream had good flow and is located within an area of old growth cedar adjacent to a recreation trail. At the time of the survey the stream was the highest volume tributary to Lizard Creek located on the east side of the valley. No fisheries information was available for the stream (MoE 2020c), however, Lizard Creek supports westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, mountain whitefish, brook trout, longnose sucker and longnose dace (MoE 2020b). PSCIS stream crossing 50159 was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the relatively large size of the stream recorded in PSCIS (channel width = 3.5m) relative to other tributary streams in the Lizard Creek watershed and because it was rated as containing high value habitat by VAST Resource Solutions Inc. (2013) and Grainger (2011). The habitat confirmation was completed on September 22, 2020. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1  Map 082G.113. Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and non-backwatered 0.8m diameter crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a pipe length of 12m, a culvert slope of 8%, a stream width ratio of 3.1 and an outlet drop of 1.6m (Table 5.5). Water temperature was 10\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.6 and conductivity was 729uS/cm. Stream Characteristics Downstream The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 150m to Lizard Creek. Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.2, Figure 5.2). The average channel width was 2.5m, the average wetted width was 2.3m and the average gradient was 8.8%. The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles subdominant. Some small pools and steps of 0.2 - 0.6m in height were present throughout the area surveyed. Large woody debris steps ranging from 0.4 - 0.8m high were spaced sporadically throughout area surveyed. The stream contained relatively flatter sections from 3 - 8% and steeper sections of 15 - 18% for first 350m above culvert (UTM: 11 U 632810 5484842) where the stream becomes too steep for upstream salmonid passage (35%). Habitat value was rated as moderate for salmonid fry/juvenile rearing and high value habitat for spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for 400m. Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and deep pools (Table 5.2, Figure 5.3). The average channel width was 3m, the average wetted width was 2.6m and the average gradient was 11.2%. There were frequent areas of gravels suitable for resident westslope cutthrout trout spawning. Frequent pools to 40cm deep were present and associated with small and large woody debris. Habitat value was rated as high for fry and juvenile westslope cutthrout rearing. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Structure replacement with a bridge is recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing 50159. The cost for the work is estimated at $125000 for a cost benefit of $0/linear m and $0/m2. Conclusion There is 0.3km of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing 50159 with habitat in the areas surveyed upstream of the crossing rated as high value for fry and juvenile salmonid rearing. The road may be part of the Island Lake Recreational tenure or solely the responsiblity of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations &amp; Rural Development.

The crossing is located on River Road just south of Morrissey approximately 15km south of Fernie. The road is accessed off of Lodgepole FSR via the Morrissey Bridge over the Elk River adjacent to Highway 3. River Road is a gravel forest tenure road (forest file id 5466 with active log hauling at the time of the survey. Background At the crossing location, the stream is 4th order with a watershed area upstream of the road of approximately 12km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 2000 to 970m at the culvert. Upstream of the crossing, there are no anthropogenic barriers on the mainstem however PSCIS crossing 50181 (also recorded as PSCIS 103033) is documented as a barrier located on a significantly sized tributary entering the stream from the north-east approximately 2.8km upstream of River Road. A wetland type area is mapped at the top of the watershed (area NAha). No fisheries information was available for the stream (MoE 2020c) however westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, mountain whitefish, brook trout, longnose sucker and longnose dace have been recorded downstream in Morrissey Creek (MoE 2020b). PSCIS stream crossing 50185 was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the large size of the stream relative to other tributary streams in the watershed, the previously rated moderate value habitat as rated by VAST Resource Solutions Inc. (2013). The habitat confirmation was completed on September 21, 2020. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1  Map 082G.108. Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and non-backwatered 2.2m diameter crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a pipe length of 17m, a culvert slope of 3.4%, a stream width ratio of 2 and an outlet drop of 0m (Table 5.7). Water temperature was 9\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.6 and conductivity was 378uS/cm. It appeared as though fish passage restoration works had taken place at the site historically as there were what appeared to be boulder riffle structures installed downstream of the crossing. The structures appeared to be effective at reducing the outlet drop size but had created a rock drop (0.4m) and were not resulting in backwatering of the culvert. Stream Characteristics Downstream The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 255m to the confluence with Morrisey Creek. The mouth of the stream is located approximately 500m upstream from the confluence of Morrissey Creek and the Elk River. Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.8, Figure 5.7). The average channel width was 4.3m, the average wetted width was 2.7m and the average gradient was 4.2%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. There were frequent pools formed by small and large woody debris ranging from 0.3 - 0.75m in depth (average residual depth = 0.4m). Pockets of small gravels suitable for resident salmonid spawning were also present. Habitat value was rated as high with good potential for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for 740m. Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.8, Figure 5.8). The average channel width was 4m, the average wetted width was 2.8m and the average gradient was 6.2%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. The stream had good flows with fry observed throughout the area surveyed. Pools to 0.6m deep (average residual depth =0.4m) were present with pockets of gravel suitable for spawning throughout. Infrequent large woody debris jams to 0.5m high were also observed. There were frequent areas of gravels suitable for resident westslope cutthrout trout spawning. Habitat value was rated as high for fry and juvenile westslope cutthrout trout rearing. Fish Sampling To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fish densities in the stream electrofishing was conducted upstream and downstream of the crossing. Four sites were sampled upstream and five sites were sampled downstream. A total of 29 westslope cutthrout trout and 22 eastern brook trout were captured upstream with 26 westslope cutthrout trout and 3 eastern brook trout captured downstream (Figure 5.9). Raw results are included in digital format as Attachment 2 and summarized in Tables 5.9 - 5.10 and Figure 5.6. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Structure replacement with an open bottomed culvert is recommended to provide unconstained access to the habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing 50185. The cost for work is estimated at $125000 for a cost benefit of $14400/linear m and $30900/m2. Conclusion There is an estimated 4.5km of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing 50185 with habitat in the areas surveyed upstream of the crossing rated as high value for fry and juvenile salmonid rearing. Fish sampling results indicated that densities of westslope cutthrout trout fry and parr were similiar upstream and downstream of the crossing with a general trend of higher densities below the crossing for both life stages. River Road is under tenure of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations &amp; Rural Development. The crossing was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement with an open bottomed structure. Table 5.7: Summary of fish passage reassessment for PSCIS crossing 50185.

"],["appendix-crossing-62423.html", "Appendix - Crossing 62423 Site Location Background Stream Characteristics at Crossing Stream Characteristics Downstream Stream Characteristics Upstream Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Conclusion", " Appendix - Crossing 62423 Grave Creek FSR - Harriet Lake Creek Site Location Crossing 62423 is located on Harriet Lake Creek, approximately 30m upstream from the confluence with Grave Creek. The stream position is mapped incorrectly in the 1:20,000 freshwater atlas stream layer and is incorrectly labelled as Grave Creek. The subject stream flows primarily from Harriet Lake which is a 6ha lake located to the north at an elevation of 2100m approximately 4km upstream of the crossing. Background Harriet Lake was stocked with wild westslope cutthrout trout five times between 1985 and 2002 (MoE 2020a). Downstream, Grave Creek is known to contain westslope cutthrout trout, rainbow trout and bull trout (MoE 2020b). Two habitat confirmation assessments were conducted downstream on the mainstem of Grave Creek in 2014 at PSCIS crossings 62421 and 62422 (Masse Environmental Consultants Ltd. 2015). Although Heather Lamson - MoE Fisheries Biologist recommended the culverts not be removed to prevent potential hybridization of westslope cutthrout trout with stocked rainbow trout downstream (Masse Environmental Consultants Ltd. 2015), both structures had been replaced with bridges at the time of the surveys. Designs and remediations of these crossings were not recorded in PSCIS. Reassessments of these crossings were conducted by our team in 2020 and results will be loaded to PSCIS. In the field, Lotic Environmental Ltd. field teams were observed conducting two-pass closed site electrofishing in Grave Creek as part of a westslope cutthrout trout population assessment and aquatic monitoring program. Data from the program is uploaded to the Fisheries Information Summary System annually and is made available through the BC Data Catalog (MoE 2020b, 2020c). Although the modelling of potential habitat upstream of this crossing was considered not accurate due to the incorrect mapping of Grave Creek, during field work planning, PSCIS stream crossing 62423 was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the large size of the modelled stream network upstream (20km) and because it was located on a stream with habitat rated as moderate value by VAST Resource Solutions Inc. (2013). A bridge (PSCIS 62413) is located approximately 1km upstream of the crossing. The habitat confirmation was completed on September 20, 2020. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1  Map 082G.124. Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and non-backwatered 0.9m diameter crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a pipe length of 12m, a culvert slope of 0.5%, a stream width ratio of 1.6 and an outlet drop of 0.18m (Table 5.11). The stream was dry at the crossing location at the time of the survey. Stream Characteristics Downstream The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 30m to Grave Creek. Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and boulders (Table 5.12, Figure 5.11). The average channel width was 1.3m, and the average gradient was 4%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders subdominant. Habitat value was rated as low low value due to a lack of flow. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert in the general location of the mapped streamline for 725m. There was a visible channel in this location with a ford (PSCIS 197563) located approximately 600m upstream. As Harriet Lake Creek was the primary source of flow for the area and enters the surveyed tributary 150m upstream of the crossing location, flows were very minimal and substrate was primarily fines above its confluence. Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and boulders (Table 5.12, Figure 5.10). The average channel width was 1.2m, the average wetted width was 0.8m and the average gradient was 4.4%. Harriet Lake Creek stream gradients modelled at 19% just upstream of the bridge located 1km upstream and too steep for upstream westslope cutthrout passage (&gt;20%) at 2.2km.Habitat value was rated as medium for fry and juvenile westslope cutthrout rearing due to steep gradients and a lack of flow in the low gradient drainage incorrectly mapped as Grave Creek. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Structure replacement with a embedded culvert is recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing 62423. The cost for the work is estimated at $25000 for a cost benefit of $63100/linear m and $45500/m2. Conclusion There is 2.4km of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing 62423 with habitat in the areas surveyed upstream of the crossing rated as medium value. The road may be part of the Island Lake Recreational tenure or solely the responsiblity of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations &amp; Rural Development.

Of note, the confluence of Grave Creek and the other channel is located approximately 175 to the west of where the confluence is mapped - likely due to a channel redirection approximately 375m upstream that appears to have occurred due to a large woody debris jam. Three PSCIS crossings (62427, 62428 and 62429) and one un-assessed modelled crossing (modelled ID 4601159) are located upstream of 62426 however, there are very minimal quantities of potential habitat upstream of their locations. Although mapped within the digital road atlas it is suspected that the road on which both culverts are located is a forest tenure road (Canfor Forest Products Ltd. tenure) as it is located immediately adjacent to another forest tenure road and within an area utilized for forestry. Background Grave Creek is known to contain westslope cutthrout trout, rainbow trout and bull trout downstream of the subject culverts and westslope cutthrout trout above (MoE 2020b). Two habitat confirmation assessments were conducted downstream on the mainstem of Grave Creek in 2014 at PSCIS crossings 62421 and 62422 (Masse Environmental Consultants Ltd. 2015). Although Heather Lamson - MoE Fisheries Biologist recommended the culverts not be removed to prevent potential hybridization of westslope cutthrout trout with stocked rainbow trout downstream (Masse Environmental Consultants Ltd. 2015), both structures had been replaced with bridges at the time of the surveys.

Data from the program is uploaded to the Fisheries Information Summary System annually and is made available through the BC Data Catalog (MoE 2020b, 2020c). PSCIS stream crossings 62425 and 62426 were ranked as moderate priorities for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the relatively large size of the stream network upstream (3.5km) and because they contained habitat rated as moderate value by VAST Resource Solutions Inc. (2013). The habitat confirmation was completed on September 20, 2020. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1  Map 082G.124. Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, both culverts were un-embedded, non-backwatered and considered barriers to upstream fish passage. PSCIS crossing 62425 was 1.2m in diameter with a pipe length of 12m, a culvert slope of 7.5%, a stream width ratio of 3.1 and an outlet drop of 0.47m (Table 5.13). PSCIS crossing 62426 was 1.2m in diameter with a pipe length of 12m, a culvert slope of 5%, a stream width ratio of 2.9 and an outlet drop of 0.25m (Table 5.14). Water temperature was 8\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.8 and conductivity was 370uS/cm. Stream Characteristics Downstream of 62425 The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 75m to where the stream joins the flow entering the valley from the south. Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, boulders, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.15, Figure 5.12). The average channel width was 3.7m, the average wetted width was 1.8m and the average gradient was 7.5%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders subdominant. Downstream of the crossing there were frequent sections of gravels suitable for salmonid spawning and no barriers or obstacles to fish passage. Habitat was rated as high value for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 62425 and Downstream of 62426 The stream was surveyed upstream from 62425 for 170m to 62426. Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris and boulders (Table 5.15, Figure 5.13). The average channel width was 3.5m, the average wetted width was 2.1m and the average gradient was 5%. There were abundant gravels suitable for resident westslope cutthrout trout spawning throughout (Figure 5.14). Some debris jam steps to 0.8m in height were observed and there were approximately 15 westslope cutthrout trout (approximately 170mm long) in the outlet pool for crossing 62426. Habitat value was rated as high for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 62426 The stream was surveyed upstream from 62426 for 650m. Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as boulders (Table 5.15, Figure 5.13). The average channel width was 3.5m, the average wetted width was 1.6m and the average gradient was 11.9%. This stream channel showed evidence of recent disturbance with eroding banks, multiple channels and aggraded sections throughout. Steps (0.6 - 0.9m in height) due to large woody debris debris jams were frequent throughout surveyed area and at a point approximately 200 m upstream of the road-stream crossing to the top end of the area surveyed, cover was limited to sporadic pools up to 0.3m deep. As mentioned previously, the historic channel was abandoned at 175m upstream of 62426 (UTM: 11 U 661748 5524558, Figure 5.14) with no flow observed within its banks. One of the tributaries that enters Grave Creek approximately 250m upstream of 62426 was accessed off of an adjacent spur road with a raped assessment conducted 250m upstream from the confluence with Grave Creek (UTM: 11U 662083 5524708). The average channel width at this location was 1.9m and the average gradient was 9%. Immediately upstream, the gradient in this tributary was 20% representing grades not likely passable for westslope cutthrout trout migrting upstream. Overall, habitat value upstream of 62426 within the mainstem of Grave Creek was rated as medium with moderate rearing potential for fry/juvenile westslope cutthrout trout. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Replacing PSCIS crossings 62425 and 62426 with bridges is recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream. The costs are estimated at $125000 and $125000 respectively for a combined cost benefit of $17600/linear m and $32000/m2. Conclusion There is 0.2km of habitat upstream of crossing 62425 with habitat rated as high value for fry and juvenile salmonid rearing and another 1.8km upstream of 62426 rated as high. Although unconfirmed, Grave Creek FSR is likely a tenure road under the responsibility of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. The crossing was ranked as moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Table 5.13: Summary of fish passage reassessment for PSCIS crossing 62425.

This culvert has also been recorded in PSCIS as crossing 50153. The stream has been diverted from its historic channel and runs adjacent to a historic road to Lizard Creek approximately 500 downstream of the location of the confluence in the freshwater atlas. Island Lake Lodge Road is an extension of Mt.Fernie Park Road which is accessed from Highway 3 within Fernie city limits. The Mt.Fernie Provincial Park is a popular recreational destination for hikers, sightseers and mountain bikers. Island Lake Lodge is located at 1400m of elevation near Island Lake and is a year round tourist destination providing accommodations, guided hiking and backcountry catskiing. Background At the crossing location, the stream had good flow and is located within an area of old growth cedar adjacent to a recreation trail. At the time of the survey the stream was the highest volume tributary to Lizard Creek located on the east side of the valley. No fisheries information was available for the stream (MoE 2020c). Downstream however, Lizard Creek supports westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, mountain whitefish, brook trout, longnose sucker and longnose dace (MoE 2020b). PSCIS stream crossing 62516 was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the relatively large size of the stream recorded in PSCIS (channel width = 3.5m) relative to other tributary streams in the Lizard Creek watershed and because it was rated as containing high value habitat by VAST Resource Solutions Inc. (2013) and Grainger (2011). There is a bridge (PSCIS 197566) located on the Lazy Lizard recreation trail approximatley 350m upstream of the crossing and an unassessed modelled crossing (modelled ID 4600929) approximately 950m upstream. Downstream approximately 400m there is a foot bridge (PSCIS 197544) on a recreational hiking/biking trail. The habitat confirmation was completed on September 23, 2020. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1  Map 082G.113. Stream Characteristics at Crossing Th culvert located at PSCIS 62516 appeared to have been replaced in 2020 with fresh rock and road fill present. At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and non-backwatered 1.2m diameter crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a pipe length of 11m, a culvert slope of 5%, a stream width ratio of 2.1 and an outlet drop of 0.49m (Table 5.16). Water temperature was 9\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.9 and conductivity was 333uS/cm. Stream Characteristics Downstream The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 630m to Lizard Creek. Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.17, Figure 5.15). The average channel width was 2.5m, the average wetted width was 1.4m and the average gradient was 2.7%. The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles subdominant. Adjacent to the historic road, on the right bank of stream, there was very limited shrub and tree riparian vegetation. Downstream of the crossing there were frequent sections of gravels suitable for salmonid spawning and no barriers or obstacles to fish passage. Habitat was rated as high value for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for 730m. Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.17, Figure 5.15). The average channel width was 2m, the average wetted width was 1.3m and the average gradient was 7.6%. There were abundant gravels suitable for resident westslope cutthrout trout spawning throughout (Figure 5.15). Fry were observed within the area surveyed to 540m upstream of the culvert where gradients increased to &gt;20% for a distance of approximately 15m. Although no sampling was conducted, no fish were observed above this high gradient section. Habitat value was rated as high for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Structure replacement with a bridge is recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing 62516. The cost for the work is estimated at $125000 for a cost benefit of $5000/linear m and $6100/m2. Conclusion There is 0.5km of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing 62516 with habitat rated as high value for fry and juvenile salmonid rearing. The road may be part of the Island Lake Recreational tenure or solely the responsiblity of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations &amp; Rural Development.

The crossing is located on the Elk River FSR approximately 10km north of Elkford, BC. The Elk River FSR is a gravel forest tenure road (forest file id 0103 with active log hauling at the time of the survey. Background At the crossing location, the stream is 4th order with a watershed area upstream of the road of approximately 17km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 2900 to 1400m at the culvert. Upstream of the crossing, there are no anthropogenic barriers on the mainstem. Although there are two modelled crossings on small tributaries that enter the stream approximately 1.5km upstream of the road, machinery operators encountered onsite indicated that they had been removed during road deactivation. No fisheries information was available for the stream (MoE 2020c) however westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, mountain whitefish, brook trout, longnose sucker and longnose dace (among other species) have been recorded downstream in the Elk River (MoE 2020b). PSCIS stream crossing 197555 was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the large amount of habitat modelled upstream of the crossing.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and non-backwatered 1.5m diameter crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a pipe length of 49m, a culvert slope of 3.5%, a stream width ratio of 2.3 and an outlet drop of 1.48m (Table 5.18). Water temperature was 6\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.2 and conductivity was 378uS/cm. Stream Characteristics Downstream The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 700m.

Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, boulders, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.19, Figure 5.18). The average channel width was 4.4m, the average wetted width was 3.1m and the average gradient was 3.6%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant . There were frequent pools formed by small and large woody debris ranging from 0.3 - 0.75m in depth (average residual depth = 0.4m). Frequent pockets of gravels suitably sized for resident and fluvial salmonid spawning were also present. Habitat value was rated as high with good potential for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for 675m. Overall, total cover amount was rated as abundant with boulders as the dominant type. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation (Table 5.19, Figure 5.19). The average channel width was 5.9m, the average wetted width was 3.8m and the average gradient was 5.9%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders subdominant. The stream had good flows with fry observed throughout the area surveyed. Pools to 0.6m deep (average residual depth = 0.4m) were present with pockets of gravel suitable for spawning throughout. Infrequent large woody debris jams to 0.5m high were also observed. Pockets of gravel suitable for resident and fluvial salmonid spawning were present throughout the area surveyed. Habitat value was rated as high for fry and juvenile westslope cutthrout trout and bull trout rearing. Fish Sampling To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fish communities in the stream, electrofishing was conducted upstream and downstream of the crossing. One 150m site was sampled upstream and one 315m site was sampled downstream. One bull trout was captured downstream and no fish were captured upstream (Figure 5.20). Raw results are included in digital format as Attachment 2 and summarized in Table 5.20. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Structure replacement with an open bottomed culvert is recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing 197555. Due to the large amount of fill on the road (8) the size of a replacement bridge was estimated at 25m. The cost for work is estimated at $312000 for a cost benefit of $21900/linear m and $38400/m2. Conclusion There is an estimated 6km of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing 197555 with habitat in the areas surveyed upstream of the crossing rated as high value for fry and juvenile salmonid rearing. However, fish sampling results indicate that westslope cutthrout trout are not currently utilizing the stream and densities of bull trout are very low. This could be the result of the cold water conditions due to the positioning of the watershed at high elevation in the generally cold Rocky Mountain setting. Elk River FSR is a forest tenure liscensee road of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations &amp; Rural Development. The crossing was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement with an open bottomed structure. Table 5.18: Summary of fish passage reassessment for PSCIS crossing 197555.
