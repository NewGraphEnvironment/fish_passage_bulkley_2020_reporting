New Graph Environment Version 0.0.1 2021 DRafT Executive Summary New Graph Environment was retained by the Habitat Conservation Trust, the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and the Canadian Wildlife Federation in 2020 to plan and conduct fish passage and habitat confirmation assessments at road-stream crossings as part of connectivity restoration planning. Although planning was conducted for both the Morice River watershed group and the Bulkley River watershed group, on the ground surveys in 2020 focused primarily within Bulkley River tributaries. A total of 31 Phase 1 assessments were conducted with 13 crossings considered passable, 3 crossings considered potential barriers and 15 crossings considered barriers according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length. Habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 24 sites with a total of approximately 18 km of stream assessed. Zero crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 0 crossings were rated as moderate priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 0 crossings were rated as a low priority and 0 crossing was rated as no fix.
