New Graph Environment 6 Regent St Nelson, BC V1L 2P1 on behalf of Society for Ecosytem Restoration Northern BC DRafT - Version 0.0.1 2021-02-10 Executive Summary New Graph Environment was retained by the Habitat Conservation Trust, the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and the Canadian Wildlife Federation in 2020 to plan and conduct fish passage and habitat confirmation assessments at road-stream crossings as part of connectivity restoration planning. Although planning was conducted for both the Morice River watershed group and the Bulkley River watershed group, on the ground surveys in 2020 focused primarily within Bulkley River tributaries. A total of 31 Phase 1 assessments were conducted with 13 crossings considered passable, 3 crossings considered potential barriers and 15 crossings considered barriers according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length. Habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 23 sites with a total of approximately 18 km of stream assessed. Thirteen crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 7 crossings were rated as moderate priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 3 crossings were rated as a low priority. "],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). Reconnection of fragmented habitats by culvert removal or replacement is a management action that can generate high ecological returns relative to other habitat restoration techniques (Saldi-Caromile et al. 2004; Roni, Hanson, and Beechie 2008). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement and deactivation designs. "],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Project Location 2.2 Wetsuweten 2.3 Gitxsan 2.4 Fisheries", " 2 Background As a result of high-level direction from the provincial government, a Fish Passage Strategic Approach protocol has been developed for British Columbia to ensure that the greatest opportunities for restoration of fish passage are pursued. A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2014) : Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment  Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity. Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation  Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation. Phase 3: Design  Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. Phase 4: Remediation  Reconnection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. 2.1 Project Location The project area includes the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups (Figure 2.1) and is within the traditional territories of the Gitxsan and Wetsuweten. The valley bottom has seen extensive settlement over the past hundred years with major population centers including the Village of Hazelton, the Town of Smithers, the Village of Telkwa and the District Municipality of Houston. The watersheds are within the Skeena, Stikine, and the Nadina Natural Resource Districts. The Bukley River is an 8th order stream that drains an area of 7,762 km2 in a generally northerly direction from Bulkley Lake on the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Skeena River at Hazleton. It has a mean annual discharge of 139.4 m3/s at station 08EE004 located near Quick and 19.6 m3/s at station 08EE003 located upstream near Houston. Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds on the west side of the northern Rocky Mountains which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures 2.2 - 2.3). Figure 2.1: Overview map of Study Areas Figure 2.2: Hydrograph for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004 - daily discharge data from 1930 to 2018) and near Houston (Station #08EE003 - daily discharge data from 1980 to 2018. Figure 2.3: Summary of hydrology statistics for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004) and near Houston (Station #08EE003). 2.2 Wetsuweten Wetsuweten hereditary territory covers an area of 22,000km2 including the Bulkley River and Morice River watersheds and portions of the Nechako River watershed. The Wetsuweten people are a matrilineal society organized into the Gilseyhu (Big Frog), Laksilyu (Small Frog), Tsayu (Beaver clan), Gitdumden (Wolf/Bear) and Laksamshu (Fireweed) clans. Within each of the clans there are are a number of kin-based groups known as Yikhs or House groups. The Yikh is a partnership between the people and the territory. Thirteen Yikhs with Hereditary Chiefs manage a total of 38 distinct territories upon which they have jurisdiction. Within a clan, the head Chief is entrusted with the stewardship of the House territory to ensure the Land is managed in a sustainable manner. Inuk Nuaten (Wetsuweten law) governing the harvesting of fish within their lands are based on values founded on thousands of years of social, subsistence and environmental dynamics. The Yintahk (Land) is the centre of life as well as culture and its management is intended to provide security for sustaining salmon, wildlife, and natural foods to ensure the health and well-being of the Wetsuweten (Office of the Wetsuweten 2013; Office of the Wetsuweten 2021; FLNRORD 2017). 2.3 Gitxsan The Gitxsan Laxyip (traditional territories) covers an area of 33,000km2 within the Skeena River and Nass River watersheds. The Laxyip is governed by 60 Simgiigyet (Hereditary Chiefs), within the traditional hereditary system made up of Wilps (House groups). Traditional governance of the Gitxsan is guided by the principles of Ayookw (Gitxsan law) (Gitxsan Huwilp Government 2021). 2.4 Fisheries Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River and Morice watershed groups are detailed in Table 2.1 (MoE 2020a). Coastal cutthrout trout and bull trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially. Table 2.1: Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups.

"],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Planning 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments 3.3 Habitat Confirmation Assessments 3.4 Reporting", " 3 Methods Workflows for the project have been classified into planning, fish passage assessments, habitat confirmation assessments and reporting. All components leveraged the R programming language and environment for statistical computing to facilitate workflow tracking and reproducibility (R Core Team 2020). 3.1 Planning To identify priorities for crossing structure rehabilitation, background literature, fisheries information, PSCIS, Fish Habitat Model outputs modified from Norris and Mount (2016) and bcfishpass (Norris 2020b) outputs were reviewed. The Fish Habitat Model was developed by the BC Ministry of Environment to provide estimates of the amount of fish habitat potentially accessible to fish upstream of crossing locations. The model calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream. The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created when the average gradient of the stream lines exceeds user provided gradient thresholds. bcfishpass is comprised of sql and python based shell script libraries that generate a simple model of aquatic habitat connectivity by identifying natural barriers to fish passage (plus hydro dams that are not feasible to remediate) and classifying all streams not upstream of these barriers as potentially accessible (Norris 2020b). On potentially accessible streams, bcfishpass scripts identify known barriers and additional anthropogenic features (primarily road/railway stream crossings, i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, the scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with known fish observations. Depending on the modelling scenario, all aquatic habitat downstream of a given fish observation can be classified as observed accessible, overriding any downstream barriers. Following delineation of non-fish habitat with the Fish Habitat Model, the average gradient of each stream segment within habitat classified as below the 22% threshold was calculated and summed using bcfishpass to quantify upstream habitat potentially available for salmonids and facilitate stream line symbology based on stream morphology. bcfishpass summed average gradients of stream network line segments within seven categories (0 - 3%, 3 - 5%, 5 - 8%, 8 - 15%, 15 - 22%, 22 - 30% and &gt;30%) with these outputs further amalgamated to summarize and symbolize potential upstream habitat in four categories: riffle/cascade (0 - 5%), step-pool (5 - 15%), step-pool very steep (15-22%) and extremely steep (22 - 30%) (Table 3.1). For each crossing location, the the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream and an estimate of watershed area was also collated using bcfishpass, fwapg (Norris 2020c) and bcfishobs (Norris 2020a) to provide an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored. Table 3.1: Stream gradient categories (threshold and average) and associated channel type. Gradient Channel Type 0 - 5% Riffle and cascade pool 5 - 15% Step pool 15 - 22% Step pool - very steep 22 - 30% Step pool - extremely steep (bull trout only) &gt;30% Non fish habitat To prepare for Phase 1 and 2 assessments in the study area, past fish passage assessment reports for the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups were first reviewed to identify crossing structures not yet assessed or previously ranked as priorities for rehabilitation (Casselman and Stanley 2010; Irvine 2018; McCarthy and Fernando 2015; Smith 2018; Wilson and Rabnett 2007). To determine which of those crossings had not yet been assessed with Phase 1 and Phase 2 assessments we cross-referenced these reports with the PSCIS database, available background info and viewed sites within the output of the Fish Habitat Model and bcfishpass. Outputs for modelled and PSCIS crossings (barriers and potential barriers) that met the following criteria underwent a detailed review to facilitate prioritization for Phase1 - Fish Passage Assessments and Phase 2 - Habitat Confirmations. Confirmed fish presence upstream of the structure. Stream width documented as &gt; 2.0m in PSCIS. Linear lengths of modelled upstream habitat &lt;22% gradient for 1km for PSCIS crossings or 2km for modelled crossings. Crossings located on streams classified as 3rd order or higher. Crossings located on streams with &gt;5 ha of modeled wetland and/or lake habitat upstream. Habitat value rated as medium or high in PSCIS. 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments In the field, crossings prioritized for follow-up were first assessed for fish passage following the procedures outlined in Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage Status of Closed Bottomed Structures (MoE 2011). Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered other (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed full assessment was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.2). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data (see Barrier Scoring), a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. Table 3.2: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). 3.2.1 Barrier Scoring Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per MoE (2011). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table 3.3, Table 3.4. These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). Table 3.3: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011). Risk LOW MOD HIGH Embedded &gt;30cm or &gt;20% of diameter and continuous &lt;30cm or 20% of diameter but continuous No embedment or discontinuous Value 0 5 10 Outlet Drop (cm) &lt;15 15-30 &gt;30 Value 0 5 10 SWR &lt;1.0 1.0-1.3 &gt;1.3 Value 0 3 6 Slope (%) &lt;1 1-3 &gt;3 Value 0 5 10 Length (m) &lt;15 15-30 &gt;30 Value 0 3 6 Table 3.4: Fish Barrier Scoring Results (MoE 2011). Cumlative Score Result 0-14 passable 15-19 potential barrier &gt;20 barrier 3.2.2 Cost Benefit Analysis A cost benefit analysis was conducted for each crossing determined to be a barrier based on an estimate of cost associated with remediation or replacement of the crossing with a structure that facilitates fish passage and the amount of potential habitat that would be made available by remediating fish passage at the site (habitat gain index). 3.2.2.1 Habitat Gain Index The habitat gain index is the quantity of modelled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing. For this project, a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 20% (for a minimimum length of 100m) intended to represent the maximum gradient of which anadromous species are likely to be able to migrate upstream. For Phase 1 assessments a net value of habitat quantity output from bcfishpass was used to estimate the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 20% gradient before either a falls of height &gt;5m - as recorded in MoE (2020b), a road-stream crossing recorded in PSCIS as a barrier, or a modelled unassessed crossing. For Phase 2 assessments, to provide a conservative estimate of habitat to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing was estimated by measuring the amount of mainstem and stream segments &gt; 1st order upstream of the crossing using the measure tool within QGIS (QGIS Development Team 2009). Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from MoE (2011) and included: Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure. For this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts. It should be noted however, that box culverts could be considered a viable and economical option as they have been observed as successfully facilitating fish passage on the west coast of the province (Betty Rebellato, Canadian Wildlife Federation - Project Biologist). Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert. Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of &lt;2m and a stream gradient of &lt;8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations. Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope &lt;1.0% and stream width ratio &lt; 1.0. Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop &lt; 0.3m, culvert slope &lt;2.0%, stream width ratio &lt; 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.. Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from FLNRORD (2020b) and FLNRORD (2020a) through bcfishpass. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson were utilized to helped refine estimates. Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was estimated at $12500/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction and a minimum bridge span of 10m. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs estimated at $25k/crossing (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page). For larger streams (&gt;6m), span width increased proportionally to the size of the stream (ex. for an 8m wide stream a 12m wide span was prescribed). For crossings with large amounts of fill (&gt;3m), the replacement bridge span was increased by an additional 3m for each 1m of fill &gt;3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was also generated to estimate incremental cost increases with costs estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways costing up to 20 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associate with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving. The cost multiplier table (Table 3.5) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects. Table 3.5: Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.

The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2011) (Table 3.2). During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collated on Site Cards. Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to the point where fish presence had been previously confirmed and upstream to a minimum distance of 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. Fish sampling was conducted a subset of sites when biological data was considered to add significant value to the physical habitat assessment information. When possible, electrofishing was utilized within discrete site units both upstream and downstream of the subject crossing with electrofisher settings, water quality parameters (i.e. conductivity, temperature and ph), start location, length of site and wetted widths (average of a minimum of three) recorded. For each fish captured, fork length and species was recorded, with results included within the fish data submission spreadsheet. Fish information and habitat data will be submitted to the province under scientific fish collection permit CB20-611971. 3.4 Reporting Reporting was generated with bookdown (Xie 2016) from Rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2020) with primarily R (R Core Team 2020) and SQL scripts. In addition to numerous spatial layers sourced through the BC Data Catalogue then stored and queried in local and remote postgresql databases, data inputs for this project include: Populated Fish Data Submission Spreadsheet Template - V 2.0, January 20, 2020 Populated pscis_assessment_template_v24.xls Fish Habitat Model/bcfishpass outputs.

Results of Phase 1 and Phase 2 assessments are summarized in Figure 4.1 with additional details provided in sections below. Figure 4.1: Map of fish passage and habitat confirmation results 4.1 Phase 1 During 2020 field surveys, a total of 30 Phase 1 assessments were conducted with 12 crossings considered passable, 3 crossings considered potential barriers and 11 crossings considered barriers according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (MoE 2011). Site details and photos are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos with maps stored here. A cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 sites that were determined to be barriers or potential barriers is presented in Table 4.1. Barrier passability criteria used in this project follows MoE (2011), and reflects an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and OHanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) as well as the temporal variation of physical characteristics (ex. due to flow volumes/velocities a particular culvert is passable 50% of the time to fish with a defined physiological capacity) make defining passability difficult with important implications for watershed connectivity modelling (Bourne et al. 2011; Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and OHanley 2010).

"],["appendix-58159-mcdowell-creek.html", "Appendix - 58159 - McDowell Creek Site Location Background Stream Characteristics at Crossing Stream Characteristics Downstream Stream Characteristics Upstream Fish Sampling Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Conclusion", " Appendix - 58159 - McDowell Creek Site Location PSCIS crossing 58159 is located on McDowell Creek on the Woodmere Nursery Road accessed from Houston, BC. The Woodmere Nursery Road is a private road owned by the Woodmere Nursery. At the time of field surveys it was used to access a newly constructed agricultural facility and by nursery operations to access a waste storage/burn pile area. Background McDowell Creek drains McDowell Lake (35ha), Dorsay Lake (4ha) and one other unnamed lake (9ha) flowing from McDowell Lake in a south then west direction for approximately 9km to the confluence with the Bulkley River. At crossing 58159, McDowell Creek is a third order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 15.9km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1000 to 520m at PSCIS crossing 58159. McDowell Creek is known to contain coho and rainbow trout upstream of the subject culvert (MoE 2020a). PSCIS stream crossings 58159 and 58158 were rated as high priorities for follow up by both Irvine (2018) and Smith (2018) due to significant quantities of upstream habitat suitable for salmonid rearing. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 093L.118. Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, the culvert was un-embedded, non-backwatered and considered a barrier to upstream fish passage. The pipe was 1m in diameter with a pipe length of 14m, a culvert slope of 3%, a stream width ratio of 2.3 and an outlet drop of 0.36m (Table 4.6). Water temperature was 11\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 8.2 and conductivity was 324uS/cm. Stream Characteristics Downstream The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 135m (Figures 4.2 - 4.3). Overall, total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, overhanging vegetation, and instream vegetation (Table 4.8). The average channel width was 2.2m, the average wetted width was 1.7m and the average gradient was 3.8%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. Habitat was rated as moderate as it was considered an important migration corridor with moderate value habitat for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from 58159 for 440m (Figures 4.4 - 4.5). Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, overhanging vegetation, and instream vegetation (Table 4.8). The average channel width was 2.2m, the average wetted width was 1.8m and the average gradient was 2%. Habitat value was rated as moderate for salmonid rearing and spawning. PSCIS culvert 58158 was documented on McDowell Creek, 500m upstream on Highway 16. The culvert has been newly replaced and is baffled with a natural type substrate throughout. Although ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage using the provincial metric the crossing is likely not a barrier during most flows for adult anadromous salmon and fluvial salmonids migrating upstream from the Bulkley River. The pipe was 2.5m in diameter with a pipe length of 53m, a culvert slope of 5.5%, a stream width ratio of 1 and an outlet drop of 0.36m (Table 4.7). Fish Sampling To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fisheries values in the stream, electrofishing was conducted upstream and downstream of the crossing. A total of 9 coho were captured downstream with 1 coho captured upstream. Although there is only moderate confidence in their identification, 19 fish captured were identified as chinook. With the exception of one coho, only rainbow trout (19 fish) were captured upstream. Sampling results are summarized in Tables 4.9 - 4.10 and Figure 4.6. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Structure replacement with a bridge (10m span) is recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing 58159. The cost of the work is estimated at $125,000 for a cost benefit of 6.2 linear m/$1000 and 13.7m2/$1000. Conclusion There is 0.8km of habitat upstream of crossing 58159. Habitat in this area was rated as moderate value for salmonid rearing/spawning. Woodmere Nursery Road is on private land owned by the Woodmere Nursury. The crossing was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Table 4.6: Summary of fish passage reassessment for PSCIS crossing 58159.

PSCIS crossing 195288 is also located on Gibson Creek on Schnider Road approximately 1.5km upstream of 195290. Both roads are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background Gibson Creek flows through an estimated 24ha of wetland type habitat into Deep Creek approximately 150m downstream of the crossing 195290. From the confluence with Gibson Creek, Deep Creek flows for approximately 1.5km to the Bulkley River. At the crossing location, Gibson Creek is a third order stream with a watershed area upstream of the highway of approximately 17.1km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1300 to 575m at PSCIS crossing 195290. Gibson Creek is known to contain rainbow trout and cutthrout trout upstream of 195290 (MoE 2020a). PSCIS stream crossings 195290 and 195288 were rated high priorities for follow up by both Irvine (2018) and Smith (2018) due to significant quantities of habitat suitable for salmonid rearing. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 093L.113. Stream Characteristics at Crossing Surveys were conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft immediately upstream and downstream of both crossings. The resulting images were stitched into orthomosaics and 3-dimensional models (4cm resolution) with models presented in Figures 4.7 - 4.8 and downloadable as a google earth kmz files here and here. Figure 4.7: Interactive 3D model of habitat immediately upstream and downstream of PSCIS crossing 195290. Figure 4.8: Interactive 3D model of habitat immediately upstream and downstream of PSCIS crossing 195288. At the time of the survey, the 195290 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and considered a barrier to upstream fish passage. The pipe was 0.8m in diameter with a pipe length of 0m, a culvert slope of 1.5%, a stream width ratio of 3 and an outlet drop of 0.66m (Table 4.11). Crossing 195288 on Schnider Road was also un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage. The pipe was 1.2m in diameter with a pipe length of 11m, a culvert slope of 1%, a stream width ratio of 2.5 and an outlet drop of 0.3m (Table 4.12). Water temperature was 13\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7 and conductivity was 315uS/cm. Stream Characteristics Downstream The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 150m to the confluence with Deep Creek (Figures 4.15 - 4.16). Overall, total cover amount was rated as abundant with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and instream vegetation (Table 4.13). The average channel width was 2.4m, the average wetted width was 2m and the average gradient was 1.7%. The dominant substrate was fines with gravels subdominant. Riparian vegetation consisted primarily of a well developed shrub layer and there were occasional pockets of small gravesl present suitable for resident salmonid spawning. Habitat was rated as moderate as it was considered an important migration corridor with moderate value habitat for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 195290 and downstream of 195288 The stream was surveyed upstream from 195290 for 150m to where survey conditions because difficult due to the wetland type habitat (Figures 4.17 - 4.18). Immediately upstream of the crossing for approximately 50m, the riparian area is dominated by well developed shrub and mature primarily deciduous forest. Upstream of this location the riparian area transitions to dense shrub and grass with a narrow and deep channel influenced by beaver activity. Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as abundant with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and instream vegetation (Table 4.13). The average channel width was 2m, the average wetted width was 1.6m and the average gradient was 1.3%. Abundant gravels and small cobbles suitable for resident, fluvial, adfluvial and anadromous salmonid spawning were present throughout the area surveyed. Habitat value was rated as moderate for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 195288 Gibson Creek was surveyed upstream from 195288 for 180m via remotely piloted vehicle as survey conditions were difficult due to the wetland type habitat present. Images acquired from the survey were stitched into an orthomosaic with stream habitat measurements estimated based on interpretation of the orthomosaic. The average channel width was estimated at 2m, the average wetted width was estimated at 2m and the average gradient was estimated at 0%. Habitat value was rated as moderate as it was considered an important migration corridor with moderate value habitat for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing. Fish Sampling To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fisheries values in the stream, electrofishing and minnowtrapping was conducted upstream and downstream of the crossing. A total of 14 fish were captured upstream with 25 fish captured downstream (Figure ??). Species captured downstream included coho, bull trout (or potentially dolly varden) and rainbow trout. Only rainbow trout were captured upstream. Electrofishing results are summarized in Tables 4.14 - Tables 4.15 and Figure 4.9 with minnowtrapping results summarized in Table 4.16. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Structure replacement with bridges for 195290 (19m span) and 195288 (10m span) are recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream. An estimate of cost for replacement of 195290 is $9,500,000 resulting in cost benefits of 0.1 linear m/$1000 and 0.2m2/$1000. An estimate of cost for replacement of 195288 is $1,000,000 resulting in cost benefits of 4.5 linear m/$1000 and 9m2/$1000. Conclusion There is 1km of habitat upstream of crossing 195290 and downstream of PSCIS barrier culvert 195288. Upstream of 195288 there is another 1km of habitat modelled as &lt;5% and containing wetland areas suitable for coho rearing. Habitat in the areas surveyed was rated as moderate value for salmonid rearing/spawning. Highway 16 and Schnider Road are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Although the sample size is small, the presence of coho downstream of the crossing and absense of this species at sites upstream indicates that the crossing may be blocking upstream migration of this species. The large outlet drop at 195290 (0.66m), long pipe length (0m) and high stream width ratio (3) are good indicators that the crossing is likely not passable in an upstream direction by any species or lifestage. The crossings were ranked as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement. Table 4.11: Summary of fish passage reassessment for PSCIS crossing 195290.

"],["appendix-197360-riddeck-creek.html", "Appendix - 197360 - Riddeck Creek Site Location Background Stream Characteristics at Crossing Stream Characteristics Downstream Stream Characteristics Upstream Fish Sampling Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Conclusion", " Appendix - 197360 - Riddeck Creek Site Location PSCIS crossing 197360 is located on Riddeck Creek at km 47 of the Morice-Owen FSR accessed from Houston, BC. The Morice-Owen FSR is a forest tenure road and the responsibility of the BC Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations &amp; Rural Development (FLNR) - Nadina District. The area immediately to the south of the subject crossing is a conservation area manged by the Nature Trust of British Columbia. Background Riddeck Creek flows through an extensive area of wetland type habitat into the top end of Owen Lake approximately 1km downstream of the crossing. Owen Lake is drained by Owen Creek emptying into the Morice River approximately 20km to the north. At the crossing location, Riddeck Creek is a 4th order stream with a watershed area upstream of the highway of approximately 29km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1140 to 750m at PSCIS crossing 197360. Riddeck Creek is known to contain longnose sucker and rainbow trout usptream of the subject culvert (MoE 2020a). On the north side of the upper watershed, at an elevation of 1160m, are the 25ha Neuch Lakes. The limit of fish distribution in the Riddeck Creek mainstem is documented by Bustard and ssociates Ltd. (1999) as a 6m high waterfall located 2.4km upstream of the FSR with the three main tributary systems classified as either non-fish bearing or fish bearing for only short distances (&lt;200m) from the mainstem. At the time of reporting, as an initiative of the Forest and Range Evaluation Program as well as the Bulkley Valley Research Centre, FLNR and the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy were undertaking a watershed status evaluation of the Owen Creek watershed (Pickard et al., n.d.). The evaluation uses remotely sensed and field based surveys to interpret the current functioning condition of the watershed as well as its possible future state as a result of continuing human and natural activities by ranking eight indicators of watershed pressure related to riparian health, fish passage and fine sediment delivery (Pickard et al. 2014; Porter et al. 2019). PSCIS stream crossing 197360 was prioritized for follow up with a habitat confirmation through consultation with Lars Reese-Hansen (Aquatic Habitat Specialist, FLNR) and Don Morgan (Wildlife Habitat Specialist, MoE). They indicated (pers comm.) that following fish passage assessments in 2014 (implemented through watershed status evaluation field surveys throughout the Owen Creek watershed), Riddeck Creek upstream of the crossing contained the highest value habitat potentially blocked by a road-stream crossing barrier. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 093L.104. Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, the culvert was un-embedded, non-backwatered and considered a barrier to upstream fish passage. The pipe was 1.2m in diameter with a pipe length of 27m, a culvert slope of 1%, a stream width ratio of 1.8 and an outlet drop of 0.24m (Table 4.17). Water temperature was 15\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 6.8 and conductivity was 140uS/cm. A survey was conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft immediately upstream and downstream of the crossing. The resulting images were stitched into a 3-dimensional model (4cm resolution) covering an area of approximatley 12ha presented in Figure 4.14 and downloadable as a google earth kmz file here. Figure 4.14: Interactive 3D model of habitat immediately upstream and downstream of PSCIS crossing 197360. Stream Characteristics Downstream The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 300m (Figures 4.15 - 4.16). Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and instream vegetation (Table 4.18). The average channel width was 3.7m, the average wetted width was 3.2m and the average gradient was 1.1%. The dominant substrate was fines with gravels subdominant. A somewhat recent burn was noted within a forested area on left bank of stream. Habitat was rated as moderate as it was considered an important migration corridor with moderate value habitat for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from 197360 for 1200m (Figures 4.17 - 4.18). Immediately upstream of the crossing for a distance of approximately 150m is a beaver influenced wetland with a beaver dam structure located approximately 40m upstream of the road. Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, boulders, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation (Table 4.18). The average channel width was 3.3m, the average wetted width was 1.8m and the average gradient was 2.7%. Abundant gravels and small cobbles suitable for resident, fluvial, adfluvial and anadromous salmonid spawning were present throughout the area surveyed. Habitat value was rated as high for salmonid rearing and spawning. PSCIS culvert 197669 was documented on Riddeck Creek, 1.2km upstream of the FSR and PSCIS crossing 197360. The culvert was un-embedded, non-backwatered and considered a barrier to upstream fish passage. The pipe was 1.25m in diameter with a pipe length of 6m, a culvert slope of 2%, a stream width ratio of 2.1 and an outlet drop of 0.45m (Table 4.19). Fish Sampling To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fisheries values in the stream, electrofishing was conducted upstream and downstream of the crossing. Two sites were sampled upstream and one site was sampled downstream. A total of 14 rainbow trout captured upstream with 2 rainbow trout captured downstream. Raw results are included in digital format as Attachment 2 and summarized in Tables 4.20 - 4.21 and Figure 4.19. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Structure replacement with a bridge (10m span) is recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing 197360. In addition to not facilitating high velocities and erosion due resulting from flow constriction, structures with large openings in relation to stream channel size have been demonstrated to reduce the likelyhood of structure blockage due to beaver (Jensen et al. 2001). The cost of the work is estimated at $125,000 for a cost benefit of 9.6 linear m/$1000 and 31.7m2/$1000. Conclusion There is 1.2km of habitat upstream of crossing 197360 and downstream of PSCIS barrier culvert 197669. Habitat in this area was rated as high value for salmonid rearing/spawning. Remediation of PSCIS culvert 197669 would facilitate fish passage to an additional 1.5km of habitat upstream of the area surveyed and should also be considered. Densities of rainbow trout fry captured at upstream sites were higher than the density of fish captured downstream however this may have been a result of habitat differences and difficult electrofishing conditions downstream including thick shrub overhead cover and areas deep water. Although only rainbow trout were captured both upstream and downstream the stream contains habitat likely suitable for spawning and rearing for other species including lamprey, burbot, coho salmon and others. In order to delineate pre-road channel locations/conditions and to inform the positioning of a replacement bridge, a pre-road hydrology assessment could be undertaken. Morice-Owen FSR is under tenure of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations &amp; Rural Development. The crossing was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Table 4.17: Summary of fish passage reassessment for PSCIS crossing 197360.

Highway 16 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 197658, Byman Creek is a fifth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 89.9km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1240 to 680m at PSCIS crossing 197658. Upstream of the highway, coho, steelhead, rainbow trout, longnose dace, redside shiner, longnose sucker and largescale sucker have been previously recorded as present (MoE 2020a). A bridge (PSCIS 197660) is a bridge located under the railway approximately 1.3km downstream. Although there are numerous crossings modelled upstream, a series of three impassable waterfalls are located approximately 6km upstream of the highway (pers. comm. Jonathan Van Barneveld, Forester - FLNR). There are only two modelled crossings (1800233, 1801084) located on a small tributary to the mainstem below the location of these waterfalls. In the summer of 1998, the Nadina Community Futures Development Corporation (NCFDC) contracted the British Columbia Conservation Foundation to carry out a detailed Level 1 Fish, Fish Habitat and Riparian Assessment in the first reach of Byman Creek as well as several other large Upper Bulkley River tributary streams and the Upper Bulkley mainstem. The area surveyed extended to 4.2km from the mouth covering 2.5km of habitat upstream of the culvert (NCFDC 1998). Building on these assessments and detailed fish sampling, NCFDC (1998) developed restoration prescriptions for the lower reaches of the Byman Creek. Prescriptions were developed to address what the authors termed moderately to severely disturbed habitat, which comprised 90% of the area surveyed. Impacts included extensive bars, elevated mid-channel bars, minimal pool frequency, eroding banks, abandoned channels, and poor LWD function due to: straightening/diversion of main channel below Highway 16. loss of riparian forest and soil compaction in areas used for agriculture, the powerline corridor, transportation corridors and at housing developments within the floodplain. loss of the shrub/herb layer and soil compaction from cattle grazing where overstory still present. removal of large woody debris which controls lateral channel movement and plant community distribution on the floodplain. Overall, NCFDC (1998) report that, in an unimpacted state, the first reach of Byman Creek (including the 2.5km upstream of the culvert) is a critical and productive area for spawning and rearing particularly for coho and steelhead. They also note that the area may be an important area for chinook salmon summer rearing and summer/fall spawning habitat as it contains larger substrate, greater foraging opportunities, greater channel complexity and cooler temperatures than present in the adjacent Bulkley mainstem. The proximity of the reach to the mainstem provides easy access to overwintering habitat, mainstem rearing areas for older juvenile salmonids and options for refuge during high flow events. Overwintering studies using minnowtrapping were conducted downstream of the highway culvert between 2005 and 2009 with coho and rainbow trout/steelhead captured. Results are summarized in Donas and Newman (2006), Donas and Newman (2007), Donas and Newman (2008) and Donas and Newman (2010). PSCIS stream crossing 197658 was ranked as a high priority for follow up by Smith (2018) and was assessed as a barrier to upstream migration during low flows (low water depth) by McCarthy and Fernando (2015). In 2007, Wilson and Rabnett (2007) assessed the site reported that fish passage at 197658 was not hindered by the culverts at that time although they were not using the assessment protocol standardized by the Fish Passage Technical Working Group (MoE 2011). A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 093L.114. Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, the culvert under Highway 16 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage acoording to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011). The pipe was 4m in diameter with a length of 24m, a culvert slope of 4%, a stream width ratio of 2.8 and an outlet drop of 2m (Table 4.22). Water temperature was 12\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.9 and conductivity was 103uS/cm. Stream Characteristics Downstream The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 300m beginning at the culvert location and then for another 330m downstream of the railway bridge (Figures 4.20 - 4.21). In the area immediately below the culvert, total cover amount was rated as trace with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris (Table 4.23). The average channel width was 11.2m, the average wetted width was 9.8m and the average gradient was 1.2%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. Within the area surveyed, the channel flowed through cattle rangeland and appeared to be straightened with low complexity. Cattle impacts were evident on both banks with grazing of riparian vegetation evident. There was minimal cover available with no pools, and extensive riffles. The habitat was rated as moderate valuable as it was considered an important migration corridor and because the larger substrate could provide important fry rearing habitat, particularly in low velocities margins. Below the railway bridge, the habitat was noted as far more complex than the area immediately below the highway culvert. Total cover amount was rated as abundant with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and deep pools. The average channel width was 8.6m, the average wetted width was 7.5m and the average gradient was 0.8%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. There were extensive sections of channel with deep glides (50-70 cm deep at the time of survey) with well developed riparian vegetation creating good structure for all species and life stages of salmonids. An algae layer was noted on the substrate. There were abundant large gravels and small cobbles present suitable for salmon spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from 197658 for 1400m (Figures 4.22 - 4.23). Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, boulders, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation (Table 4.23). The average channel width was 12.9m, the average wetted width was 7.9m and the average gradient was 2.1%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders subdominant. Within the area surveyed, riparian areas adjacent to both banks were used as rangeland with several cattle access points on the stream and evidence of understory shrub degradation from cattle grazing. The large stream had high habitat complexity including numerous pools up to 2m deep and frequent glide sections to 1m deep throughout. There were also extensive areas of gravel suitable for spawning for resident and anadromous species. Habitat value was rated as high for salmonid rearing and spawning. Fish Sampling Minnowtrapping was conducted with three traps set overnight upstream as well as downstream of the crossing. A total of 5 coho and 6 rainbow trout were captured downstream with 1 coho and 9 rainbow trout were captured upstream (Table 4.24 and (Figures 4.24 - 4.25). Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Structure replacement with a bridge (15.1m span) is recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing 197658. The cost of the work is estimated at $7,550,000 for a cost benefit of 0.8 linear m/$1000 and 10.3m2/$1000. Conclusion There is 6km of habitat upstream of crossing 197658. Habitat in this area was rated as high value for salmonid rearing/spawning. The crossing may present a barrier not only to fry and juvenile salmonids at moderate and high flow velocities, but also due to shallow water depths when adult salmon potentially migrate upstream to spawn during low flows. Restoration of riparian forests, cattle exclusion, bank stabilization and habitat complexing could be considered alongside fish passage restoration activities. Highway 16 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. The crossing was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement.

Highway 16 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background Richfield Creek drains one of the largest tributary watersheds in the upper Bulkley River. At crossing 197662, Richfield Creek is a fifth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 161.3km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1660 to 680m at PSCIS crossing 197662. Upstream of the highway, Richfield Creek is known to contain coho, chinook, steelhead, rainbow trout, longnose dace and longnose sucker (MoE 2020a). A bridge (modelled crossing 1805593) is located under the railway approximately 830m downstream of the crossing which is reported by Wilson and Rabnett (2007) to constrict the channel. Although numerous modelled crossings are located upstream of the highway an impassable waterfall is located approximately 2km upstream of the highway (pers. comm. Jonathan Van Barneveld, Forester - FLNR). In the summer of 1998, the Nadina Community Futures Development Corporation (NCFDC) contracted the British Columbia Conservation Foundation to carry out a detailed Level 1 Fish, Fish Habitat and Riparian Assessment in the first two reaches of Richfield Creek as well as several other large Upper Bulkley River tributary streams and the Upper Bulkley mainstem. The area surveyed extended to approximately 2km upstream of the culvert where an 18m high waterfall is located (NCFDC 1998). Building on these assessments and detailed fish sampling, NCFDC (1998) developed restoration prescriptions for the lower reaches of the watershed based on the following assessment of impacts: loss of riparian forest and soil compaction in areas used for agriculture, the powerline corridor, transportation corridors and at housing developments within the floodplain. loss of the shrub/herb layer and soil compaction from cattle grazing where overstory still present. removal of large woody debris which controls lateral channel movement and plant community distribution on the floodplain.

They also note that the area may be an important area for chinook salmon summer rearing and summer/fall spawning habitat as it contains larger substrate, greater foraging opportunities, greater channel complexity and cooler temperatures than present in the adjacent Bulkley mainstem. The proximity of the reach to the mainstem provides easy access to overwintering habitat, mainstem rearing areas for older juvenile salmonids and options for refuge during high flow events. Overwintering studies using minnowtrapping were conducted downstream of the highway culvert between 2006 and 2009 with coho, rainbow trout/steelhead and northern pikeminnow captured. Results are summarized in Donas and Newman (2007), Donas and Newman (2008) and Donas and Newman (2010). A water temperature monitoring station has been operational on Richfield Creek just upstream of the highway since November 2014 with results presented in Westcott (2020). Westcott (2020) also reports that a continuous water level and temperature monitoring station is proposed on the stream. Although in 2007, Wilson and Rabnett (2007) reported that fish passage at 197662 was not hindered by the culverts at that time the site was rated as a priority for follow up following background review and a Phase 1 assessment in 2020 indicating that the crossing was not passable according to provincial metrics and due to the presence of significant quantities of upstream habitat suitable for salmonid rearing and spawning. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 093L.115. Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, the two culverts under Highway 16 were un-embedded, non-backwatered and considered a barrier to upstream fish passage. The pipes were 4.2m in diameter with lengths of 24m, a culvert slope of 2%, a stream width ratio of 3 and an outlet drop of 0.2m (Table 4.25). Water temperature was 11\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.8 and conductivity was 80uS/cm. Stream Characteristics Downstream The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 300m (Figures 4.26 - 4.27). Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation (Table 4.26). The average channel width was 12.5m, the average wetted width was 8.8m and the average gradient was 1.5%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels subdominant. There were unembedded gravels and cobbles suitable for spawning present throughout. Immediately downstream of the culverts for approximately 80m, channel structure was simplified, with armoured banks, no pools and high flow velocities out of crossing structure pipes. Further downstream, the channel flows through a residential area with some deep pools and glides to over 1m deep. Riparian vegetation is comprised of a narrow band of mature cottonwood forest with some areas lacking treed riparian near houses. There was evidence of large woody debris removal from channel (chainsaw cut logs in the stream) and some stream corners were armoured with rock, concrete and old vehicles. Habitat was rated as high as it was considered an important migration corridor with moderate value habitat for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from 197662 for 1200m (Figures 4.28 - 4.29). Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation (Table 4.26). The average channel width was 13.2m, the average wetted width was 9m and the average gradient was 2.1%. The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles subdominant. Within the area surveyed, riparian areas adjacent to both banks were used as rangeland with several cattle access points on the stream and evidence of understory shrub degradation from cattle grazing. There was a debris jam (up to 1m high in places) located just upstream The large stream had high habitat complexity including numerous pools up to 2m deep and frequent glide sections to 1m deep throughout. There were also extensive areas of gravel suitable for spawning for resident and anadromous species. Robert Hatch Creek enters the main channel approximately 400m upstream of the culvert and was comprised of beaver influenced wetland type habitat adjacent to Richfield Creek. Habitat value was rated as high for salmonid rearing and spawning. Fish Sampling Minnowtrapping was conducted with three traps set overnight upstream as well as downstream of the crossing. A total of 6 coho and 8 rainbow trout were captured downstream. Only rainbow trout (8 fish) were captured upstream (Table 4.27 and (Figures 4.30 - 4.31). Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Structure replacement with a bridge (16.5m span) is recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream of PSCIS crossing 197662. The cost of the work is estimated at $8,250,000 for a cost benefit of 0.2 linear m/$1000 and 3.2m2/$1000. Conclusion There is 2km of habitat upstream of crossing 197662. Habitat in the area surveyed upstream of the crossing was rated as high value for salmonid rearing/spawning. The crossing may present a barrier not only to fry and juvenile salmonids due to the small outlet drop and high flow velocities within the pipes but also to adult salmon potentially migrating upstream to spawn during low flows due to shallow water depths. Electrofishing upstream and downstream of the crossing is recommended to provide presence/absence as well as density data for chinook salmon, coho salmon and other species. Highway 16 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure and was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement.

Highway 16 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. PSCIS crossing 3054 is located on North road at km 42.4 approximately 10km upstream of Highway 16. North road is the responsibility of FLNR - Nadina Forest District. Background The Johnny David Creek creek watershed upstream of the highway is approximately 43.5km2 in area with an estimated 91ha of wetland documented upstream. At the highway, (575m of elevation) Johnny David Creek is a fourth order stream with a maximum watershed elevation of 1300. Fish documented as present downstream of 197663 include coho, chinook, cutthrout, dolly varden, steelhead and rainbow trout (MoE 2020a). Upstream of the crossing, only rainbow trout have been previously documented. One road stream crossing structure is modelled as present approximately 3km upstream of the highway (modelled crossing id 1802089). Although, the stream was not surveyed at this location, it is suspected that the crossing is a ford and not an issue for fish passage as the roads in the area are very old with crossing structures likely removed. The Johnny David Creek creek watershed upstream of 3054 is approximately 13km2 in area with an estimated 71ha of wetland documented upstream. The stream is third order at this location with rainbow trout documented as present upstream (MoE 2020a). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) recommended that PSCIS crossing 197663 be a high priority for remedial works to backwater the crossing by establishing a series of pools to step up to the outfall pool. A rehabilitation design was prescribed by Gaboury and Smith (2016). Smith (2018) reported that in 2017, the Wetsuweten First Nation - Yinka Dene Economic Development Limited Partnership Inc. and LGL Limited constructed three rock riffles and berms on both banks to backwater the stream and raise the outlet pool water level to above the elevation of the base of the culvert. PSCIS stream crossing 3054 was rated a moderate priority for follow up by Irvine (2018) as it was rated as having moderate value habitat by Casselman and Stanley (2010) and due to significant quantities of stream and wetland habitat modelled upstream. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 093L.115. Stream Characteristics at Crossings 197663 and 3054 At the time of the survey, the 197663 on Highway 16 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and considered a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol. The pipe was 1.75m in diameter with a length of 25m, a culvert slope of 2%, a stream width ratio of 3.6 and an outlet drop of 0m (Table 4.28). The inlet of the culvert was damaged with the metal folded up by incoming debris. Water temperature was 11\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 8.1 and conductivity was 186uS/cm. Crossing 3054 on North road was also un-embedded, non-backwatered and again ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage. The pipe was 3m in diameter with a length of 40m, a culvert slope of 2%, a stream width ratio of 1.2 and an outlet drop of 0.76m (Table 4.29). Water temperature was 10\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.5 and conductivity was 85uS/cm. Stream Characteristics Downstream of 197663 The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 300m (Figures 4.33 - 4.34). Overall, total cover amount was rated as moderate with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation (Table 4.30). The average channel width was 5.3m, the average wetted width was 3.3m and the average gradient was 2.6%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders subdominant. Abundant gravels suitably sized for coho, rainbow and steelhead spawning were present. Habitat was rated as high as it was considered an important migration corridor with moderate value habitat for fry/juvenile salmonid rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 197663 and downstream of 3054 The stream was surveyed upstream from 197663 for 690m (Figures 4.35 - 4.36). Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, boulders, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation (Table 4.30). The average channel width was 6.6m, the average wetted width was 4.4m and the average gradient was 3%. Abundant gravels and small cobbles suitable for resident, fluvial, adfluvial and anadromous salmonid spawning were present throughout the area surveyed. Habitat value was rated as high for salmonid rearing and spawning. The stream was surveyed downstream from 3054 for 300m (Figures 4.37 - 4.38). Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as abundant with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, overhanging vegetation, and instream vegetation (Table 4.30). The average channel width was 3.5m, the average wetted width was 2.3m and the average gradient was 3.3%. Some pockets of gravels suitable for resident and anadromous (if present) salmonids were present throughout the area surveyed. Stream gradients were steepest immediately below the FSR then leveled off with a series of three beaver dams. No deep pools were observed downstream of the beaver influenced areas. Habitat value was rated as moderate as it was considered an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat with moderate rearing potential for resident adult or fry/juvenile anadromous salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 3054 Johnny David Creek was surveyed upstream from 3054 for 725m until an area of wetland type habitat (Figures 4.39 - 4.40). The stream winds through a canyon section for approximately 300m after the first 100m of beaver influenced wetland located directly upstream of the culvert. Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as moderate with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation (Table 4.30). The average channel width was 2.6m, the average wetted width was 2.1m and the average gradient was 5.3%. Substrate was noted as colored black from periphyton with pockets of gravel suitable for resident (~20cm) salmonids present. A fish observed (~150mm long) was observed above the culvert approximately 100m. Habitat value was rated as moderate for younger life stages of fluvial and anadromous salmonid rearing and resident adult salmonid spawning. Fish Sampling To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fisheries values in the stream, electrofishing and minnowtrapping was conducted upstream and downstream of 197663. A total of 30 fish were captured upstream with 60 fish captured downstream (Figure 4.35). Species captured downstream included coho and rainbow trout iwth coho, rainbow trout and mountain whitefish captured upstream. Electrofishing results are summarized in Tables 4.31 - 4.32 and Figure 4.32 with minnowtrapping results summarized in Table 4.33. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Structure replacement with bridges for 197663 (10.3m span) and 3054 (31m span) are recommended to provide access to the habitat located upstream. An estimate of cost for replacement of 197663 is $5,150,000 resulting in cost benefits of 1.2 linear m/$1000 and 7.7m2/$1000. An estimate of cost for replacement of 3054 is $388,000 resulting in cost benefits of 19.3 linear m/$1000 and 50.3m2/$1000. Conclusion Although no natural barriers to upstream passage are documented within provincial databases on Johnny David Creek upstream of the highway, large waterfalls have been documented within adjacent streams on both sides (Byman Creek and Richfield Creek pers. comm. Jonathan Van Barneveld, Forester - FLNR) at points approximately 6km upstream from the highway. For this reason, we suspect a natural barrier within Johnny David Creek within this same band of slope. Although, the stream was not surveyed at the location of a modelled road stream crossing approximately 3km upstream of the highway (modelled crossing id 1802089), it is suspected that the crossing is not present as the roads in the area appear old and un-maintained in aerial imagery. Future assessment to confirm these assumptions is recommended. There is 6km of habitat upstream of crossing 197663 to where a natural barrier to fish passage is suspected. Habitat in the areas surveyed immediately upstream of 197663 was rated as high value for salmonid rearing/spawning. Although the sample size is small, the electrofishing results indicate that there are higher densities of coho and rainbow trout downstream of the crossing than above which could be an indication of impact of the structure. Although some works have already been conducted to reduce the impact of the crossing on upstream migration of fish, the culvert is damaged and likely presents a barrier to smaller life stages during moderate to high flows (due to flow velocities) and to large adult fish during low flows. The crossing was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Although we suspect that fish from the lower reaches would not be able to access to North Road, there is 7.5km of mainstem habitat modelled upstream of 3054. Highway 16 is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Habitat in the areas surveyed immediately upstream of 3054 was rated as moderate value for salmonid rearing/spawning with FLNR - Nadina Forest District responsible for North road. The crossing was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Table 4.28: Summary of fish passage reassessment for PSCIS crossing 197663.
