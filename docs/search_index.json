New Graph Environment Version 0.0.1 2021-01-15 DRafT Executive Summary New Graph Environment was retained by the Habitat Conservation Trust, the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and the Canadian Wildlife Federation in 2020 to plan and conduct fish passage and habitat confirmation assessments at road-stream crossings as part of connectivity restoration planning. Although planning was conducted for both the Morice River watershed group and the Bulkley River watershed group, on the ground surveys in 2020 focused primarily within Bulkley River tributaries. A total of 31 Phase 1 assessments were conducted with 13 crossings considered passable, 3 crossings considered potential barriers and 15 crossings considered barriers according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length. Habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 24 sites with a total of approximately 18 km of stream assessed. Ten crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 6 crossings were rated as moderate priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 3 crossings were rated as a low priority. "],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). Reconnection of fragmented habitats by culvert removal or replacement is a management action that can generate high ecological returns relative to other habitat restoration techniques (Saldi-Caromile et al. 2004; Roni, Hanson, and Beechie 2008). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded as part of road maintenance there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair and replacement designs. "],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Project Location 2.2 Fisheries", " 2 Background As a result of high-level direction from the provincial government, a Fish Passage Strategic Approach protocol has been developed for British Columbia to ensure that the greatest opportunities for restoration of fish passage are pursued. A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2014) : Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment  Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity. Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation  Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation. Phase 3: Design  Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. Phase 4: Remediation  Reconnection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. 2.1 Project Location To focus the project area on habitat with high value for conservation of westslope cutthrout trout, the project included the upper Elk River watershed upstream of the Elko Dam with planning also conducted for the Flathead River watershed (Figure ??. The Bukley River has a mean annual discharge of 139.4 m3/s at station 08EE004 located near Quick and 19.6 m3/s at station 08EE003 located upstream near Houston. Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds on the west side of the northern Rocky Mountains which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures 2.1 - 2.2).

"],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Planning 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments 3.3 Habitat Confirmation Assessments 3.4 Reporting", " 3 Methods Workflows for the project can be classified into planning, fish passage assessments, habitat confirmation assessments and reporting. All components leveraged the R programming language and environment for statistical computing to facilitate workflow tracking and reproducibility (R Core Team 2020). 3.1 Planning To identify priorities for crossing structure rehabilitation, background literature, fisheries information, PSCIS, Fish Habitat Model outputs modified from Norris and Mount (2016) and bcfishpass (Norris 2020b) outputs were reviewed. The Fish Habitat Model was developed by the BC Ministry of Environment to provide estimates of the amount of fish habitat potentially accessible to fish upstream of crossing locations. The model calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream. The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created when the average gradient of the stream lines exceeds user provided gradient thresholds. bcfishpass is comprised of sql and python based shell script libraries that generate a simple model of aquatic habitat connectivity by identifying natural barriers to fish passage (plus hydro dams that are not feasible to remediate) and classifying all streams not upstream of these barriers as potentially accessible (Norris 2020b). On potentially accessible streams, bcfishpass scripts identify known barriers and additional anthropogenic features (primarily road/railway stream crossings, i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, the scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with known fish observations. Depending on the modelling scenario, all aquatic habitat downstream of a given fish observation can be classified as observed accessible, overriding any downstream barriers. Following delineation of non-fish habitat with the Fish Habitat Model, the average gradient of each stream segment within habitat classified as below the 22% threshold was calculated and summed using bcfishpass to quantify upstream habitat potentially available for westslope cutthrout trout and facilitate stream line symbology based on stream morphology. bcfishpass summed average gradients of stream network line segments within seven categories (0 - 3%, 3 - 5%, 5 - 8%, 8 - 15%, 15 - 22%, 22 - 30% and &gt;30%) with these outputs further amalgamated to summarize and symbolize potential upstream habitat in four categories: riffle/cascade (0 - 5%), step-pool (5 - 15%), step-pool very steep (15-22%) and extremely steep (22 - 30%) (Table 3.1). For each crossing location, the the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream and an estimate of watershed area was also collated using bcfishpass, fwapg (Norris 2020c) and bcfishobs (Norris 2020a) to provide an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored. Table 3.1: Stream gradient categories (threshold and average) and associated channel type. Gradient Channel Type 0 - 5% Riffle and cascade pool 5 - 15% Step pool 15 - 22% Step pool - very steep 22 - 30% Step pool - extremely steep (bull trout only) &gt;30% Non fish habitat To prepare for Phase 1 and 2 assessments in the study area, past fish passage assessment reports for the Elk River watershed group were first reviewed to identify crossing structures not yet assessed or previously ranked as priorities for rehabilitation in VAST Resource Solutions Inc. (2013) and Grainger (2011). To determine which of those crossings had not yet been assessed with Phase 1 and Phase 2 assessments we cross-referenced these reports with the Phase 2 report previously completed in the study area by Masse Environmental Consultants Ltd. (2015) and reviewed outputs from PSCIS as well as the Fish Habitat Model and bcfishpass. Outputs for modelled and PSCIS crossings (barriers and potential barriers) that met the following criteria underwent a detailed review to facilitate prioritization for Phase1 - Fish Passage Assessments and Phase 2 - Habitat Confirmations. Confirmed fish presence upstream of the structure. Stream width documented as &gt; 2.0m in PSCIS. Linear lengths of modelled upstream habitat &lt;22% gradient for 1km for PSCIS crossings or 2km for modelled crossings. Crossings located on streams classified as 3rd order or higher. Crossings located on streams with &gt;5 ha of modeled wetland and/or lake habitat upstream. Habitat value rated as medium or high in PSCIS. 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments In the field, crossings prioritized for follow-up were first assessed for fish passage following the procedures outlined in Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage Status of Closed Bottomed Structures (MoE 2011). Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered other (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed full assessment was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.2). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data (see Barrier Scoring), a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. Table 3.2: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). 3.2.1 Barrier Scoring Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per MoE (2011). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table 3.3, Table 3.4. These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). Table 3.3: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011). Risk LOW MOD HIGH Embedded &gt;30cm or &gt;20% of diameter and continuous &lt;30cm or 20% of diameter but continuous No embedment or discontinuous Value 0 5 10 Outlet Drop (cm) &lt;15 15-30 &gt;30 Value 0 5 10 SWR &lt;1.0 1.0-1.3 &gt;1.3 Value 0 3 6 Slope (%) &lt;1 1-3 &gt;3 Value 0 5 10 Length (m) &lt;15 15-30 &gt;30 Value 0 3 6 Table 3.4: Fish Barrier Scoring Results (MoE 2011). Cumlative Score Result 0-14 passable 15-19 potential barrier &gt;20 barrier 3.2.2 Cost Benefit Analysis A cost benefit analysis was conducted for each crossing determined to be a barrier based on an estimate of cost associated with remediation or replacement of the crossing with a structure that facilitates fish passage and the amount of potential habitat that would be made available by remediating fish passage at the site (habitat gain index). 3.2.2.1 Habitat Gain Index The habitat gain index is the quantity of modelled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing. For this project, a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 20% (for a minimimum length of 100m) intended to represent the maximum gradient of which westslope cutthrout trout are likely to be able to migrate upstream. For Phase 1 assessments a net value of habitat quantity output from bcfishpass was used to estimate the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 20% gradient before either a falls of height &gt;5m - as recorded in MoE (2020), a road-stream crossing recorded in PSCIS as a barrier, or a modelled unassessed crossing. For Phase 2 assessments, to provide a conservative estimate of habitat to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing was estimated by measuring the amount of mainstem and stream segments &gt; 1st order upstream of the crossing using the measure tool within QGIS (QGIS Development Team 2009). Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from MoE (2011) and included: Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure. For this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts. It should be noted however, that box culverts could be considered a viable and economical option as they have been observed as successfully facilitating fish passage on the west coast of the province (Betty Rebellato, Canadian Wildlife Federation - Project Biologist). Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert. Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of &lt;2m and a stream gradient of &lt;8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations. Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope &lt;1.0% and stream width ratio &lt; 1.0. Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop &lt; 0.3m, culvert slope &lt;2.0%, stream width ratio &lt; 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.. Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from FLNRORD (2020b) and FLNRORD (2020a) through bcfishpass. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson were utilized to helped refine estimates. Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was estimated at $12500/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs estimated at $25k/crossing (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page). For larger streams, an additional 2m was added to the replacement structures estimated span width for each 1m of channel width &gt;5m. For crossings with large amounts of fill, the size of replacement structure was increase by 3m for each 1m or fill &gt;3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was also generated to estimate incremental cost increases with costs estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways costing up to 20 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associate with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving. The cost multiplier table (Table 3.5) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects. Table 3.5: Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.

The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2011) (Table 3.2). During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collated on Site Cards. Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to the point where fish presence had been previously confirmed and upstream to a minimum distance of 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. Fish sampling was conducted a subset of sites when biological data was considered to add significant value to the physical habitat assessment information. When possible, electrofishing was utilized within discrete site units both upstream and downstream of the subject crossing with electrofisher settings, water quality parameters (i.e. conductivity, temperature and ph), start location, length of site and wetted widths (average of a minimum of three) recorded. For each fish captured, fork length and species was recorded, with results included within the fish data submission spreadsheet. Fish information and habitat data will be submitted to the province under scientific fish collection permit CB20-611971. 3.4 Reporting This pdf report and an online interactive report were generated with bookdown (Xie 2016) from Rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2020) documents processing raw data available at the New Graph Environment Github Site.

Results of Phase 1 and Phase 2 assessments are summarized in Figure 4.1 with additional details provided in sections below. Figure 4.1: Map of fish passage and habitat confirmation results 4.1 Phase 1 During 2020 field surveys, a total of 30 Phase 1 assessments were conducted with 12 crossings considered passable, 3 crossings considered potential barriers and 11 crossings considered barriers according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (MoE 2011). Site details and photos are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos with maps stored here. A cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 sites that were determined to be barriers or potential barriers is presented in Table 4.1. Barrier passability criteria used in this project follows MoE (2011), and reflects an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and OHanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) as well as the temporal variation of physical characteristics (ex. due to flow volumes/velocities a particular culvert is passable 50% of the time to fish with a defined physiological capacity) make defining passability difficult with important implications for watershed connectivity modelling (Bourne et al. 2011; Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and OHanley 2010).
