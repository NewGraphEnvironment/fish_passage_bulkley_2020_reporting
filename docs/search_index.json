The culvert is located approximately 70m upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River. Buck Flats Road is a the responsibility of the B.C. Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 197640, tributary to Buck Creek is a second order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 23.9km2 containing an estimated 129ha of wetland. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1460m to 820m at PSCIS crossing 197640. Upstream of Buck Flats Road, rainbow trout have been previously recorded as present. Chinook, coho and pink salmon noted as spawning downstream in Buck Creek (MoE 2020a, @wilson_rabnett2007FishPassage; NCFDC 1998). Pink salmon have been noted as spawning in the first reach with coho spawners noted to Reach 3 and chinook spawners to Reach 5 where the subject tributary enters the mainstem (NCFDC 1998). DFO (1991) report that Buck Creek supports a small chinook population ranging from 12-100 spawners. Three water temperature sensors have been deployed on the stream since 2016 (Westcott 2020). The closest water sensor to the subject stream is near the 9km mark of Buck Flats Road approximately 100m upstream of the bridge on the left bank cabled to alder in run habitat (UTM: 9U.653072.6019700). The sensor has been gathering water temperature data at 1hour intervals since 2017 with data available through the Skeena Salmon Data Centre (DFO/FLNRO 2019). There are multiple tributaries entering the mainstem of the subject stream upstream of crossing 197640 containing numerous modelled road stream crossings however these tributaries are not expected to contain valuable habitats due to the small size of their contributing watersheds. PSCIS stream crossing 197640 was ranked as a high priority for follow up following 2020 Phase 1 - fish passage assessments that targeted all major streams in the Buck Creek watershed. Crossing 197640 was noted as located on the stream with the highest value habitat in the watershed that was potentially blocked to anadromous species by a road-stream crossing structure. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 093L.109. Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, the culvert under Buck Flats Road was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011). The pipe was 1.5m in diameter with a length of 12m, a culvert slope of 1.5%, a stream width ratio of 3.4 and an outlet drop of 0.4m (Table 4.1). Water temperature was 10\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.6 and conductivity was 226uS/cm. Stream Characteristics Downstream The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for 70m to the confluence with Buck Creek (Figures 4.1 - 4.2). Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and overhanging vegetation (Table 4.3). The average channel width was 4.6m, the average wetted width was 2.5m and the average gradient was 3%. The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles subdominant. A fish (130mm) was observed in the culvert outlet pool and a substance suspected to be didymo was noted on the substrate. The habitat was rated as NA value as it was considered an important migration corridor with habitat suitable for fry and juvenile salmonid rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed immediately upstream from 197640 for approximately 535m (Figures 4.3 - 4.4). Within the area surveyed, total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, boulders, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation (Table 4.3). The average channel width was 4.4m, the average wetted width was 2.2m and the average gradient was 2.5%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders subdominant. Rare pockets of gravel suitable for spawning resident, fluvial and anadromous salmonids were noted. The stream appeared to be aggraded with side bars common. One salmonid (110mm) was observed near start of survey. Habitat value was rated as NA value for fry and juvenile salmonid rearing. One crossing (PSCIS 197647) was assessed on an upstream tributary crossed by the Carrier FSR. This tributary that enters the subject stream approximately 3.3km upstream of 197640, was dry at the time of the survey and did not provide any viable fish habitat (Table 4.2). Numerous fish inventory sample sites were located downstream of this tributary within the adjacent tributary to the subject stream with no fish observations recorded in two seasons of sampling (MoE 2020b). Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Replacement of PSCIS crossing 197640 with a bridge (10m span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at $NA for a cost benefit of NA linear m/$1000 and NAm2/$1000. Conclusion A conservative estimate of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing 197640 is NAkm. Rainbow trout have been recorded to this location within a 71ha wetland. Habitat in the areas surveyed upstream of the culvert were rated as NA value for salmonid rearing with the wetland habitat visible within aerial imagery likely suitable for coho and steelhead rearing. Buck Flats Road is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. The crossing was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement.
